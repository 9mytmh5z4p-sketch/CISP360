# Dates & Random Numbers in C++


## Working with Dates and Times

Sometimes we need to get the current date and/or time.

C++ provides functionality to work with dates and times through the `<ctime>` library.

## Getting the Current Date and Time

```cpp
// dateTime.cpp -- date & time example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    time_t now = time(nullptr);
    cout << asctime(localtime(&now)) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Wed Feb  1 18:19:01 2023
```

## Understanding the Date/Time Components

**`time_t`** is a data type that represents time as a number (typically seconds since January 1, 1970).

**`time(nullptr)`** gets the current time and stores it in a `time_t` variable.

**`localtime(&now)`** converts the `time_t` value to a structure containing the broken-down local time (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).

**`asctime()`** converts the time structure into a human-readable string format.

## Practical Uses

### Date and Time
- Logging and timestamps
- Scheduling and timing events
- Calculating elapsed time
- Displaying current date/time to users


## Random Numbers

Sometimes we need to generate random numbers in our programs. C++ provides several ways to accomplish this, ranging from simple to more sophisticated approaches.

## Basic Random Number Generation

The simplest way to generate random numbers in C++ is using the `rand()` function from the `<cstdlib>` library.

## A Simple Example

Type this in.

```cpp
//3-30.cpp -- random numbers
// generates the same numbers
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>     // for rand
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << rand() << "\t";
    cout << rand() << "\t";
    cout << rand() << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Rerun and examine the output. What do you notice about the numbers?

**Problem:** This program will generate the same sequence of "random" numbers every time you run it!

**Why?** Because the starting value of the random number generator or seed, does not change. This leads to the same result every time it's run.

::: {.incremental}
To get different random numbers each time the program runs, we need to "seed" the random number generator with a different number using `srand()`.

## Using Time as a Seed

```cpp
//3-32.cpp -- useful random numbers
// generates the same numbers
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>     // for rand
#include <ctime>       // for time
using namespace std;

int main() {
    unsigned seed;
    // seed = 100;              // for debugging
    seed = time(0);             // different random numbers
    srand(seed);                // randomize
    
    cout << rand() << "\t";
    
    // 6 sided die
    cout << rand() % 6 + 1 << "\t";
    
    // random number between 8 and 12
    cout << (rand() % (12 - 8 + 1)) + 8 << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

::: notes
Type this in and run. We use the seed for debugging.

## Understanding the Seeding Process

**`time(0)`** returns the current time in seconds since January 1, 1970 (Unix epoch). Since this value changes every second, it provides a different seed value each time you run the program.

**`srand(seed)`** initializes the random number generator with the seed value, ensuring different sequences of random numbers.

## Generating Random Numbers in Specific Ranges

## Simulating a Six-Sided Die

To generate a random number between 1 and 6:

```cpp
rand() % 6 + 1
```

**How it works:**
- `rand() % 6` produces values from 0 to 5
- Adding 1 shifts the range to 1 to 6

## Random Numbers in Any Range

To generate a random number between a minimum and maximum value:

```cpp
(rand() % (max - min + 1)) + min
```

**Example:** For a random number between 8 and 12:

```cpp
(rand() % (12 - 8 + 1)) + 8
```

This formula works because:
- `12 - 8 + 1 = 5` (there are 5 possible values: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
- `rand() % 5` produces 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Adding 8 shifts these to 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12

## Practical Uses

## Random Numbers
- Game development (dice rolls, random events)
- Simulations and modeling
- Generating test data
- Cryptographic applications (though more sophisticated methods are needed for security)

## Important Notes

**Pseudo-random vs. True Random:** The `rand()` function generates pseudo-random numbers. They appear random but follow a deterministic sequence based on the seed. For most applications, this is sufficient.

**Better Alternatives:** Modern C++ (C++11 and later) provides more sophisticated random number generation through the `<random>` library, which offers better statistical properties and more control over distributions.
