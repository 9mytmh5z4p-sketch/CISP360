# Key Takaways

1. **Scope and Shadow Variables.** Scope enforces a hierarchy of variable visibility defined by brace-delimited blocks — a variable is accessible only at the level it was declared or below — and a shadow variable occurs when an inner block redeclares a name that already exists in an outer scope, silently hiding the original.

2. **Advanced Input Handling with `cin`.** `getline()` must be used in place of `cin >>` whenever input can contain spaces, and `cin.ignore()` is required between any `cin >>` and a subsequent `getline()` to discard the leftover newline character that would otherwise be read as an empty input.

3. **Random Number Generation.** `rand()` produces a deterministic sequence by default; calling `srand()` with a time-based seed before use ensures a different sequence on each run, and the modulo operator combined with an offset constrains the output to any desired range.
