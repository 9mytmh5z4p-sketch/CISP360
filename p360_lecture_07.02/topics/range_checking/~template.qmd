# Range Checking

How can we verify that a value falls within acceptable limits before using it in our program? Today we'll learn how to use logical operators to check if values are within or outside specific ranges.

## What is Range Checking?

Range checking is the process of verifying that a value falls within acceptable minimum and maximum boundaries. This validation prevents errors and ensures data meets program requirements.

Common applications include validating user input, checking array indices, and enforcing business rules. For example, checking that a test score is between 0 and 100, or that an age is positive.

## Using AND for Values Within a Range

The AND operator (&&) checks if a value satisfies multiple conditions simultaneously. Use it to verify a value is within a range by checking it is greater than or equal to the minimum AND less than or equal to the maximum.

```cpp
int age = 25;
if (age >= 18 && age <= 65) {
    cout << "Working age adult";
}

double temp = 72.5;
if (temp >= 68.0 && temp <= 78.0) {
    cout << "Comfortable temperature";
}
```

Both conditions must be true for the overall expression to be true.

## Using OR for Values Outside a Range

The OR operator (||) checks if at least one condition is true. Use it to verify a value is outside a range by checking it is less than the minimum OR greater than the maximum.

```cpp
int score = 105;
if (score < 0 || score > 100) {
    cout << "Invalid score";
}

double price = -5.99;
if (price < 0.0 || price > 1000.0) {
    cout << "Price out of range";
}
```

Only one condition needs to be true for the overall expression to be true.

## Comparing AND vs OR for Range Checking

Use AND (&&) when checking if a value is inside a range. The value must satisfy both the lower bound AND the upper bound conditions.

Use OR (||) when checking if a value is outside a range. The value only needs to violate either the lower bound OR the upper bound to be invalid.

```cpp
// Inside range: must be >= 1 AND <= 10
if (x >= 1 && x <= 10) { /* valid */ }

// Outside range: either < 1 OR > 10
if (x < 1 || x > 10) { /* invalid */ }
```

## Summary

Use AND (&&) to check if a value is within a range and OR (||) to check if a value is outside a range. These logical operators allow efficient validation of boundaries in a single expression.

## Common Practices

Always define your boundaries clearly before writing range checks to avoid confusion about whether to use inclusive or exclusive comparisons. Document whether boundary values are valid or invalid.

Use parentheses to make complex range checks more readable even when not strictly required. This improves code clarity and prevents operator precedence errors.

## Common Mistakes

Confusing AND with OR is a frequent error in range checking. Remember that AND means "both conditions" for inside a range, while OR means "either condition" for outside a range.

Using the wrong comparison operators can create logic errors. For inclusive ranges use `>=` and `<=`, while for exclusive ranges use `>` and `<`.

Writing `1 <= x <= 10` does not work in C++. You must write it as two separate conditions: `x >= 1 && x <= 10`.

## More Examples

```cpp
// Checking month validity (1-12)
int month = 6;
if (month >= 1 && month <= 12) {
    cout << "Valid month";
}

// Checking for invalid percentage
double percent = 150.0;
if (percent < 0.0 || percent > 100.0) {
    cout << "Invalid percentage";
}

// Checking grade range (A-F only)
char grade = 'C';
if (grade >= 'A' && grade <= 'F') {
    cout << "Valid letter grade";
}

// Detecting extreme temperatures
int temp = -15;
if (temp < -10 || temp > 110) {
    cout << "Extreme temperature warning";
}
```

## Practice Problems

1. Write a range check to determine if a variable `hours` contains a valid hour of the day (0-23).
2. Write a condition to check if a `password_length` is invalid (either less than 8 or greater than 20 characters).
3. Create a range check to verify that a `gpa` is between 0.0 and 4.0 (inclusive).
4. Write code to check if a `day` variable is a valid day of the month for February in a non-leap year (1-28).

## Questions for Reflection

1. Why does checking if a value is within a range require AND while checking if it's outside requires OR?
2. What happens if you accidentally use OR instead of AND when checking if a value is within a range?
3. How would you check if a value is within one of two separate ranges (for example, 1-10 or 20-30)?
4. Why is it important to validate input ranges before using values in calculations or array operations?
