# Key Takaways

1. **Function-Centric Architecture**. A program design approach organizing code around functions as primary building blocks, separating data and behavior through a top-down design where main problems are broken into smaller sub-problems implemented as functions.
2. **Void Functions**. Functions declared with void return type perform actions without returning values, used to organize code, avoid repetition, and improve readability through descriptive function names that act as labels for code blocks.
3. **Passing Data and Function Prototypes**. Functions accept input through parameters and return output via return statements, with function prototypes declared before main to enable forward references and organize code with definitions below main.
