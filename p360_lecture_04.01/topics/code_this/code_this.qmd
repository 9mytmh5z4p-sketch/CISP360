# Code This: Pizza Order Calculator

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

## Problem Description

Write a program that calculates the cost of a pizza order. Your program should use multiple functions to break down the calculation into logical steps.

## Requirements

Your program must include the following functions:

1. **calculatePizzaCost** - Takes the pizza size (small, medium, or large) as a character ('S', 'M', or 'L') and returns the base cost as a double.
   - Small: $8.99
   - Medium: $12.99
   - Large: $16.99

2. **calculateToppingsCost** - Takes the number of toppings as an integer and returns the total topping cost as a double.
   - Each topping costs $1.50

3. **calculateTotal** - Takes the pizza cost and toppings cost as parameters and returns the final total as a double.

4. **displayReceipt** - A void function that takes the pizza size (char), number of toppings (int), and total cost (double) as parameters and displays a formatted receipt.

## Sample Output

For a medium pizza with 3 toppings, your program should display:

```
Pizza Order Receipt
-------------------
Size: M
Toppings: 3
-------------------
Total: $17.49
```

## Your Task

1. Write function prototypes for all four functions
2. Implement the main() function to:
   - Create variables for pizza size ('M') and number of toppings (3)
   - Call the functions in the correct order
   - Display the receipt
3. Implement all four function definitions below main()

## Starter Code Structure

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

// Write your function prototypes here

int main() {
    // Your code here
    
    return 0;
}

// Write your function definitions here
```

## Tips

- Remember to use function prototypes before main()
- The displayReceipt function should use cout with proper formatting
- Use setprecision(2) and fixed for dollar amounts
- Make sure your function calls pass arguments in the correct order
- Test with the given values first: size 'M' and 3 toppings

## Challenge (Optional - if you finish early)

Modify your program to ask the user for their pizza size and number of toppings using cin, then display the receipt with their choices.
