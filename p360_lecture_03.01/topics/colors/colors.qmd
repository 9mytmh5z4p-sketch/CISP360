## Introduction to Terminal Colors

Making your console programs more visually appealing is easy with terminal color codes! By using special escape sequences, you can change the color of text displayed in the terminal, making your output more readable and engaging.

## What Are ANSI Escape Codes?

ANSI escape codes are special character sequences that tell the terminal to change text attributes like color, background, and style. These codes work on most modern terminals, including Linux, macOS, and Windows (Windows 10 and later).

## Basic Color Implementation

## A Simple Color Example

Here's a complete program that demonstrates how to use color codes:

```cpp
// simCol.cpp -- simple terminal color example
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    const string RED = "\033[031m;";
    const string YELLOW = "\033[033m;";
    const string NORM = "\033[0m";
    
    cout << RED << "Hello" << NORM << endl;
    cout << YELLOW << "there" << NORM << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
./main
;Hello
;there
```

The text "Hello" appears in red, and "there" appears in yellow!

## Understanding the Color Code Format

Each color code follows this pattern:

```
\033[COLORm
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `\033` is the escape character (ESC in ASCII)
- `[` starts the color sequence
- `COLOR` is the color code number
- `m` ends the sequence

## Common Color Codes

Here are the most frequently used foreground (text) color codes:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- `\033[030m` - Black
- `\033[031m` - Red
- `\033[032m` - Green
- `\033[033m` - Yellow
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- `\033[034m` - Blue
- `\033[035m` - Magenta
- `\033[036m` - Cyan
- `\033[037m` - White

## The Importance of NORM (Reset)

The `NORM` constant is crucial:

```cpp
const string NORM = "\033[0m";
```

**`\033[0m`** resets all text attributes back to the terminal's default. Always use this after colored text to prevent all subsequent output from being colored!

## Practical Usage Tips

## Storing Colors as Constants

It's best practice to define color codes as named constants at the beginning of your program:

```cpp
const string RED = "\033[031m";
const string GREEN = "\033[032m";
const string BLUE = "\033[034m";
const string NORM = "\033[0m";
```

This approach offers several benefits:

- Makes your code more readable
- Easy to modify colors throughout your program
- Prevents typos in color codes

## Using Colors in Output

To color your text, simply insert the color code before the text and reset after:

```cpp
cout << RED << "Error: File not found!" << NORM << endl;
cout << GREEN << "Success! Operation completed." << NORM << endl;
cout << YELLOW << "Warning: Low disk space." << NORM << endl;
```

## Common Practices

**Always reset colors:** Remember to use `NORM` after colored text to avoid coloring unintended output.

**Use colors meaningfully:** 

- Red for errors or important warnings
- Green for success messages
- Yellow for caution or warnings
- Blue for informational messages

**Test on your target terminal:** Not all terminals support the same color codes, so test your program on the systems where it will run.

## Finding More Information

If you want to explore more color options and text effects, you can search online for:

**"How do I output colored text to a Linux terminal?"**

This will lead you to resources about:

- Background colors
- Bold and italic text
- Underlined text
- Bright/bold color variants
- 256-color and true color support

## Additional Color Codes to Explore

**Bright/Bold Colors:** Add 60 to the color code or use the bold attribute:

- `\033[091m` - Bright Red
- `\033[092m` - Bright Green
- `\033[093m` - Bright Yellow

---

**Background Colors:** Use codes 40-47 for background colors:
- `\033[041m` - Red background
- `\033[042m` - Green background
- `\033[044m` - Blue background

---

**Text Styles:**
- `\033[1m` - Bold
- `\033[4m` - Underline
- `\033[7m` - Reverse (swap foreground and background)

## Try This!

```.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Define color codes as const strings
    const string NORM = "\033[0m";
    const string RED = "\033[031m";
    const string GREEN = "\033[032m";
    const string YELLOW = "\033[033m";
    const string BLUE = "\033[034m";
    const string MAGENTA = "\033[035m";
    const string CYAN = "\033[036m";
    const string WHITE = "\033[037m";
    
    // Store them in a vector
    vector<string> colors = {
        NORM,    // 0
        RED,     // 1
        GREEN,   // 2
        YELLOW,  // 3
        BLUE,    // 4
        MAGENTA, // 5
        CYAN,    // 6
        WHITE    // 7
    };
    
    // Now you can use either the named constants OR the vector
    // This gives you the best of both worlds!
    cout << RED << "Using the constant directly" << NORM << endl;
    cout << colors[1] << "Using the vector" << colors[0] << endl;
    
    int i = 0;
    for (auto COLOR:colors)
        cout << COLOR << i++ << NORM << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Exercise: Practice with Colors

Now it's your turn! Try these exercises to practice using terminal colors:

## Exercise 1: Colorful Greeting

Add colored text to a simple greeting program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    const string RED = "\033[031m";
    const string GREEN = "\033[032m";
    const string BLUE = "\033[034m";
    const string NORM = "\033[0m";
    
    // Your code here: create a colorful greeting
    
    return 0;
}
```
 

## Exercise 2: Menu System

Create a simple menu with colored options:

- Use one color for the menu title
- Use different colors for different menu items
- Use another color for the prompt

## Exercise 3: Status Messages

Write a program that displays different types of status messages:

- Red for errors
- Yellow for warnings  
- Green for success
- Blue for information

Remember to add more output and experiment with different color combinations!

## Summary

Terminal color codes are a simple way to make your console programs more visually appealing and user-friendly. By using ANSI escape sequences stored in string constants, you can easily add color to any text output. Just remember to:

1. Define color codes as constants
2. Use meaningful colors for different types of messages
3. Always reset to normal after colored text
4. Test on your target terminal
