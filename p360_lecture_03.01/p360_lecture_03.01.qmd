# Key Takaways

**Debugging in C++**. Compiler error messages include a line number, error type, and description — and the actual error often resides on the line before the one flagged — so reading them carefully is the first step in any debugging workflow.
**Systematic Debugging Techniques**. Five core techniques are presented — reading error messages, commenting out code, inserting print statements, simplifying complex expressions, and verifying assumptions (particularly around integer division and operator precedence) — and together they form a repeatable cycle of reproduce, isolate, understand, fix, test, and learn.
**Terminal Color Codes**. ANSI escape sequences (e.g., \033[031m for red) can be stored as named const string constants to colorize terminal output; a reset sequence (\033[0m) must always follow colored text to prevent unintended coloring of subsequent output.
