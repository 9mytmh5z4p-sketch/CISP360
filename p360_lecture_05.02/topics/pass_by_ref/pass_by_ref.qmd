# Pass by Reference

Why can't a function change the value of a variable we pass to it? Today we'll learn how to give functions the power to modify the original variables.

## Review: Pass by Value

When we pass a variable to a function, C++ makes a copy of that value. The function works with the copy, not the original variable.

```cpp
void addTen(int x) {
    x = x + 10;  // changes the copy only
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    addTen(num);
    cout << num;  // still prints 5
}
```

::: notes
Consider a diagram showing two separate memory locations: one for 'num' in main, one for 'x' in the function.

## What is Pass by Reference?

Pass by reference allows a function to work directly with the original variable instead of a copy. Changes made inside the function affect the original variable.

Think of it as giving the function access to the actual storage location of your variable.

A diagram showing a single memory location accessed by both main and the function would be helpful here.

## Syntax for Pass by Reference

To pass by reference, add an ampersand (`&`) after the type in the parameter list.

```cpp
void addTen(int& x) {  // note the &
    x = x + 10;
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    addTen(num);
    cout << num;  // now prints 15
}
```

The only change is adding `&` to the parameter declaration.

## How Pass by Reference Works

When you pass by reference, the parameter and the original variable are two different names for the same memory location. Changing one changes the other because they're actually the same variable.

```cpp
void demo(int& ref) {
    ref = 100;  // changes the original
}

int main() {
    int original = 50;
    demo(original);  // original is now 100
}
```

## Example: Swapping Two Variables

Pass by reference is essential when a function needs to modify multiple variables.

```cpp
void swap(int& a, int& b) {
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    swap(x, y);
    cout << x << " " << y;  // prints 20 10
}
```

## When to Use Pass by Reference

Use pass by reference when a function needs to modify the original variable. Common scenarios include functions that update values, swap variables, or return multiple results.

Use pass by value when the function should not change the original variable.

## Pass by Reference with Const

Use `const` with pass by reference when you want to avoid copying without allowing changes. This prevents accidental modifications.

```cpp
void display(const int& num) {
    cout << num;     // can read the value
    // num = 10;     // error: can't modify
}
```

The `const` keyword protects the original variable from being changed.

## Common Practices

Always use `const` with reference parameters unless the function needs to modify the variable. This documents your intent and prevents errors.

Use descriptive parameter names that indicate the parameter will be modified. Names like `result`, `output`, or `updated` signal that a parameter may change.

## Summary

Pass by reference uses the `&` symbol to allow functions to modify original variables. It creates an alias to the original variable rather than a copy.
