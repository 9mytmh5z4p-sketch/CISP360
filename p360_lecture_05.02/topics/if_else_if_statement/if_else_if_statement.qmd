# The if/else if Statement

How can a program choose between multiple different options when only one should execute? Now, we'll learn how if/else if statements let us handle multiple mutually exclusive conditions efficiently.

## The Problem:<br> Multiple Mutually Exclusive Conditions

Sometimes we need to check several conditions where only one outcome should occur. Using multiple independent if statements can lead to problems when multiple conditions are true.

```{.cpp code-line-numbers="3,6"} 
int score = 85;
if (score >= 60) {
    cout << "Pass";
}
if (score >= 80) {
    cout << "Honor Roll";  // both execute, printing "PassHonor Roll"
}
```

We need a way to execute only the most appropriate condition and skip the rest.

## Introduction to if/else if Syntax

The if/else if structure allows us to check multiple conditions in sequence, executing only the first one that is true.

```cpp
if (condition1) {
    // executes if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // executes if condition1 is false AND condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // executes if condition1 and condition2 are false AND condition3 is true
} else {
    // executes if all conditions are false
}
```

The final else clause is optional but provides a default action.

## How if/else if Chains Are<br> Evaluated

The program evaluates conditions from top to bottom and stops at the first true condition. Once a condition is true and its code executes, all remaining conditions are skipped.

## Topics

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
```cpp
int x = 15;
if (x > 20) {
    cout << "Large";
} else if (x > 10) {
    cout << "Medium";  // this executes
} else if (x > 5) {
    cout << "Small";   // this is skipped
}
```
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

Only one block executes, even if multiple conditions could be true.

## Example: Grade Calculator

A complete if/else if/else chain provides comprehensive coverage of all possibilities.

```cpp
int score = 87;

if (score >= 90) {
    cout << "Grade: A";
} else if (score >= 80) {
    cout << "Grade: B";
} else if (score >= 70) {
    cout << "Grade: C";
} else if (score >= 60) {
    cout << "Grade: D";
} else {    //else clause ensures every possible score receives a grade.
    cout << "Grade: F";
}
```

## Common Use Cases

Grade assignment systems use if/else if chains to categorize numeric scores into letter grades. Each range is mutually exclusive, making this structure ideal.

## Common Use Cases

Menu-driven programs use if/else if to handle user selections where only one option should execute. The structure ensures that selecting option 1 doesn't also trigger option 2.

## Common Use Cases

Categorization tasks like age groups, temperature ranges, or price tiers benefit from if/else if chains. The sequential checking stops as soon as the correct category is found.

## When to Use if/else if vs<br> Multiple if Statements

Use if/else if chains when conditions are mutually exclusive and only one action should occur. This is more efficient because it stops checking after finding the first true condition.

. . . 

Use multiple independent if statements when multiple conditions might be true and you want all corresponding actions to execute. Each if statement is checked regardless of the others.

## Example

```cpp
// if/else if: only one executes
if (temp > 90) { cout << "Hot"; }
else if (temp > 70) { cout << "Warm"; }

// Multiple ifs: both could execute
if (temp > 70) { cout << "Above 70"; }
if (temp < 100) { cout << "Below 100"; }
```

## Summary

The if/else if statement allows checking multiple mutually exclusive conditions efficiently by stopping at the first true condition. Use it when only one of several options should execute.

## Common Practices

Always arrange conditions from most specific to least specific when ranges overlap. This ensures more restrictive conditions are checked first and prevents them from being skipped.

Include a final else clause when you want to handle all possible cases. This provides a default action and makes your code more robust by ensuring no valid input is ignored.

<!-- Appendix Slide 1 -->

---

## Common Mistakes

Reversing the order of conditions can cause incorrect results. Placing `score >= 60` before `score >= 90` means all scores above 60 will match the first condition and never reach the higher grade checks.

Forgetting that only one block executes can lead to logic errors. If you need multiple actions for overlapping conditions, you need multiple independent if statements, not an if/else if chain.

## More Examples

```cpp
// Menu selection
int choice;
cout << "Enter choice (1-3): ";
cin >> choice;

if (choice == 1) {
    cout << "Starting new game\n";
} else if (choice == 2) {
    cout << "Loading saved game\n";
} else if (choice == 3) {
    cout << "Exiting\n";
} else {
    cout << "Invalid choice\n";
}

// Age categorization
int age = 25;
if (age < 13) {
    cout << "Child";
} else if (age < 20) {
    cout << "Teenager";
} else if (age < 65) {
    cout << "Adult";
} else {
    cout << "Senior";
}
```

## Practice Problems

1. Write an if/else if/else chain that assigns shipping costs: free for orders >= $100, $10 for orders >= $50, $15 for orders < $50.
2. Create a program that categorizes a temperature in Fahrenheit: freezing (< 32), cold (32-50), moderate (51-70), warm (71-85), hot (> 85).
3. What will this code output if x = 25? `if (x > 30) cout << "A"; else if (x > 20) cout << "B"; else if (x > 10) cout << "C";`
4. Write an if/else if chain for a traffic light system that takes a char input ('R', 'Y', 'G') and outputs the appropriate action.

## Questions for Reflection

1. Why is the order of conditions important in an if/else if chain when checking numeric ranges?
2. In what situations would multiple independent if statements be more appropriate than an if/else if chain?
3. How does adding a final else clause improve the robustness of your code?
4. What happens if you have overlapping conditions in an if/else if chain and why does order matter?
