# Reference Variables as Parameters

How can functions modify the original variables passed to them? Reference variables provide an alternative way to pass arguments to functions in C++.

## Using Reference Parameters

When a parameter is declared with an ampersand, it becomes a reference to the original variable rather than a copy.

```cpp
void increment(int& num) {
    num++;  // Modifies the original variable
}

void displayValue(const int& value) {
    cout << "Value: " << value << endl;  // Cannot modify value
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    increment(x);  // x is now 6
    displayValue(x);  // Outputs: Value: 6
    return 0;
}
```

Reference parameters allow functions to modify the original arguments. Adding `const` prevents modification while still avoiding copies.

::: notes
A diagram showing two memory boxes would be helpful here: one showing pass-by-value with separate copies, and another showing pass-by-reference with both variables pointing to the same memory location.

## Reference Variables as Return Values

Returning a reference to a local variable creates a dangling reference that points to memory that no longer exists after the function ends.

```cpp
// DANGEROUS - Do not do this
int& badFunction() {
    int localVar = 10;
    return localVar;  // localVar is destroyed when function ends
}

int main() {
    int& ref = badFunction();  // ref points to invalid memory
    cout << ref << endl;  // Undefined behavior
    return 0;
}
```

Local variables are destroyed when their function scope ends, making any reference to them invalid and causing unpredictable program behavior.

A memory diagram showing the stack frame being destroyed when the function returns would illustrate why the reference becomes invalid.
