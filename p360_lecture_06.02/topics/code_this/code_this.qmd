## Problem Description

Write a program that automatically processes coffee shop orders stored in a vector. Your program will use a menu-driven approach where drink codes are pre-loaded in a vector, and the system processes each order without requiring user input. This simulates an automated order processing system like those used in modern coffee shops.

## Background: Automated Menu Processing

Traditional menu-driven programs ask users to select options repeatedly. In this assignment, you'll create an automated system where:
- Drink codes are stored in a vector (e.g., 1 for Espresso, 2 for Latte, etc.)
- The program processes each code automatically using a for-each loop
- A switch statement handles different drink types
- Functions calculate prices, track orders, and generate summaries
- No user input is required - the system processes pre-loaded orders

This approach is used in real-world systems like mobile app orders, batch processing, and automated kiosks.

## The Coffee Shop Menu

Your coffee shop offers 5 drinks:

| Code | Drink Name        | Price  |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| 1    | Espresso          | $2.50  |
| 2    | Latte             | $3.75  |
| 3    | Cappuccino        | $4.00  |
| 4    | Mocha             | $4.50  |
| 5    | Americano         | $3.00  |

Any other code should be treated as "Unknown Item" with a price of $0.00.

## Requirements

Your program must include the following functions:

1. **getDrinkName** - Takes a drink code (integer) and returns the drink name as a string.
   - Return type: string
   - Use a switch statement to return the appropriate drink name
   - For codes 1-5, return the drink name
   - For any other code, return "Unknown Item"

2. **getDrinkPrice** - Takes a drink code (integer) and returns the price as a double.
   - Return type: double
   - Use a switch statement to return the appropriate price
   - For codes 1-5, return the price
   - For any other code, return 0.00

3. **processOrder** - Takes a drink code (integer) and order number (integer), and displays the order details.
   - Return type: void
   - Parameters: int code, int orderNumber
   - Call getDrinkName and getDrinkPrice to get drink information
   - Display the order number, drink name, and price in a formatted line
   - Example: "Order #1: Espresso - $2.50"

4. **displayMenu** - Takes no parameters and displays the coffee shop menu.
   - Return type: void
   - Display a formatted menu showing all drink options with codes and prices

5. **calculateTotal** - Takes a vector of drink codes and returns the total cost.
   - Return type: double
   - Parameters: vector<int> orders
   - Use a for-each loop to process each code in the vector
   - Call getDrinkPrice for each code and sum the prices
   - Return the total
   - Note: This function demonstrates separation of concerns - calculating the total is separate from displaying orders

## Sample Output

For a vector containing orders {1, 2, 1, 4, 3}, your program should display:

```
========================================
     COFFEE SHOP ORDER PROCESSOR
========================================

MENU:
1. Espresso          - $2.50
2. Latte             - $3.75
3. Cappuccino        - $4.00
4. Mocha             - $4.50
5. Americano         - $3.00

========================================
PROCESSING ORDERS...
========================================

Order #1: Espresso - $2.50
Order #2: Latte - $3.75
Order #3: Espresso - $2.50
Order #4: Mocha - $4.50
Order #5: Cappuccino - $4.00

========================================
SUMMARY
========================================
Total Orders: 5
Total Cost: $17.25
========================================
```

## Your Task

1. Write function prototypes for all five functions
2. Implement the main() function following these steps in order:
   - Set output formatting with fixed and setprecision(2)
   - Display the title header "COFFEE SHOP ORDER PROCESSOR"
   - Create a vector of integers: {1, 2, 1, 4, 3}
   - Call displayMenu to show the menu
   - Display "PROCESSING ORDERS..." header
   - Create an order counter variable (starts at 1)
   - Use a for-each loop to process each order code:
     - Call processOrder with the code and counter
     - Increment the counter
   - Display the summary section
   - Display total number of orders (use vector.size())
   - Call calculateTotal and display the result
3. Implement all five function definitions below main()

## Starter Code Structure

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

// Write your function prototypes here

int main() {
    // Set output formatting for currency
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
    
    // Your code here
    
    return 0;
}

// Write your function definitions here
```

## Tips

- Remember to use function prototypes for all functions before main()
- Use `#include <vector>` to work with vectors
- Use `#include <iomanip>` and `cout << fixed << setprecision(2)` for 2 decimal places
- Create your vector: `vector<int> orders = {1, 2, 1, 4, 3};`
- For-each loop syntax: `for(int code : orders)`
- In switch statements, use `break` after each case
- Don't forget the `default` case in your switch statements
- To get vector size: `orders.size()`

**Loop Structure with Counter:**
```cpp
int orderNum = 1;
for(int code : orders) {
    processOrder(code, orderNum);
    orderNum++;
}
```

**Output Formatting Tips:**
- Create separator lines: `cout << "========================================" << endl;`
- Center text by adding spaces before it
- Use consistent spacing between sections
- Display currency with $ symbol: `cout << "$" << price << endl;`

## Example of Switch Statement for Drink Names

```cpp
string getDrinkName(int code) {
    string name;
    
    switch(code) {
        case 1:
            name = "Espresso";
            break;
        case 2:
            name = "Latte";
            break;
        // Continue for other cases...
        default:
            name = "Unknown Item";
            break;
    }
    
    return name;
}
```

## Challenge (Optional - if you finish early)

1. Add a **getDiscountedPrice** function that applies a 10% discount if ordering 3 or more of the same drink
2. Create a function that finds and displays the most popular drink from the orders
3. Add drink size options (Small, Medium, Large) with different pricing
4. Calculate and display average order price

## Important Notes

- All orders are pre-loaded in the vector - no user input required
- The program processes orders automatically using a for-each loop
- Switch statements must handle all drink codes (1-5) plus a default case
- Use proper formatting for currency display
- Keep track of order numbers starting from 1
- The total should be calculated by processing the entire vector

## Processing Flow

1. Display the menu
2. Loop through the orders vector using for-each
3. For each order code:
   - Call processOrder to display the order
   - Increment order counter
4. After loop completes, display summary with total orders and total cost
