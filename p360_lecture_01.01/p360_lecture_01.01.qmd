This slide is deliberately lightweight.
You will expand most of this vertically later.

# Key Takaways

**Philosophy**: Focuses on **Structured Programming** and logical reasoning (sequence, selection, iteration) rather than just syntax.

**Core Elements**: Differentiates between **Identifiers** (custom names), **Reserved Words** (compiler-fixed), and **Literals** (fixed data).

**Comments**: Essential for explaining programmer intent and debugging; completely ignored by the compiler.

**Structure**: Every program requires **Top Matter** (environment setup and headers) and a **`main()` function** for execution.

# Printed Copies

You can turn the browser lecture slides into a pdf. It will be an Ok copy. Here's how you do it:

1. In the slide URL
2. delete any text up to .html
3. add ?print-pdf
4. File -> print in your browser to print a pdf.
