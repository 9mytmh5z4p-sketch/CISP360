- Pre-processor directives
- Name space specifications

## Top Matter
### Source File Header

```{.cpp code-line-numbers="1-4"}
// intro.cpp
// Dr. Fowler
// 1/1/26
// CISP360 introductory program.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()

```

## Top Matter
### Source File Header

```{.cpp code-line-numbers="1-4"}
// program name
// author name
// date written
// brief description
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()

```

All expect all programs to have these four lines of code at the top.

## Top Matter
### The `#include` Directive

The `#include` directive tells the compiler to include the contents of another file before compilation begins.

It is handled by the **preprocessor**, not by the C++ compiler itself.

---

## Why #include Exists

Programs are built from multiple pieces of code.

`#include` allows you to:

- Reuse existing code
- Access library functionality
- Keep programs modular and readable

---

## Angle Brackets vs Quotes

```cpp
// Standard Library Header
#include <iostream>

// User Defined or old C libraries
#include "myheader.h"
```

- Angle brackets `< >`
  - Used for **standard library headers**
- Double quotes `" "`
  - Used for **user-defined headers**

::: notes
Yes, you can create your own libraries.
No, we won't do it in here.

## iostream

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

- Provides input/output facilities
- Enables:
  - `cout`
  - `cin`
  - `endl`
- Required for basic terminal interaction

---

## What Actually Gets Included?

Conceptually, `#include` works like a copy-and-paste.

When the preprocessor runs:

- The contents of the header file are inserted
- The compiler then compiles the expanded source

---

## Preprocessing Happens First

Compilation occurs in stages:

1. Preprocessing
2. Compilation
3. Linking

`#include` is resolved entirely during **preprocessing**.

---

## Headers Do Not Contain Executable Code

Header files typically contain:

- Function declarations
- Class declarations
- Constants

They usually do **not** contain:

- `main`
- Executable statements

---

## But, the Preprocessor is its Own Language

- You can program with it.
- Preprocessor errors **cannot** be detected by the C++ compiler!
- You can introduce hard to solve errors into your program.
- Don't include any other directives than `#include`.

## I've heard about other libraries

Yes, historically, there were other libraries.

- The C Standard Library
- The C++ Standard Library
- The Standard Template Library
- The Boost Library
\
We don't need to worry about that today. Many of the features of the standard template library have been included within the C++ standard library. The C standard library is not for C++. The boost library is still used, but not in this class. [Citation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Why Headers Matter

Using headers correctly:

- Reduces duplication
- Improves organization
- Enables large programs
- Supports team development

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Forgetting to include required headers
- Including headers unnecessarily
- Confusing headers with source files

---

## Key Takeaways

- `#include` is a preprocessor directive
- It brings in external declarations
- Angle brackets and quotes have different meanings
- Headers enable modular programming

---

## Top Matter
### Namespaces

```{.cpp code-line-numbers="6"}
// intro.cpp
// Dr. Fowler
// 1/1/26
// CISP360 introductory program.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()

```

- std is the standard namespace
- Prevents naming conflicts
- Allows shorter names (cout instead of std::cout)

::: notes
Yes, you can create your own namespace.
No, we aren't doing it in this class.
