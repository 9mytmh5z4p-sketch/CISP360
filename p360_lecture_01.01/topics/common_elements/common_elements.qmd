# Common Elements


::: notes

What every program uses
:::

---

## All programs use these elements

- Identifiers
- Reserved Words
- Literals
- Comments

---

## Identifiers

These are words that you get to name.
C++ doesn't care what they're called.

Example: age, myArray, MakeMoney(), GoHome(), yo

---

## Reserved Words

These are words you **do not** get to name.
C++ very much cares about these words because they mean something to the compiler.

Example: `int`, `main()`, `#include`, `if`, `for`


---

## Why Should You Care

If you mix up and use a reserved word where you should have used an identifier

Or

You use a an identifier where you should've used a reserved word, 
your program will not compile or run.


---

## Literals

```{.cpp}
// Examples of literals

cout << "Run, Spot, Run" << endl;

// Magic Number
myTax = salary * myRate + 8345.11;

```

- this is data which is hardcoded into your program.
- this is **not** under program control.
- C++ allows you to get around that.


---

## Comments

```{.cpp}

// This is a single-line comment

/*
   This is a multi-line comment
   See, another line
*/

```


- Comments are ignored by the compiler
- Used to explain intent
- Used to temporarily disable code (debugging)

---

## Write Comments

- Use them to help your future self understand what you are doing.
- We have plenty of memory these days, use it.
- The best comments expose our intent.

---

## Useful Comments

```{.cpp}

// Helpful
float age;   // store months after decimal, that's why not an int

// Unhelpful
float age;   // this is a float (no kidding)

```

---

## Whole Line vs End-of-Line Comments

```{.cpp}

// Whole line comment because it uses an entire line

int age;  // End-of-line comment, use only with variables

```

Whole line comments are preferred because code frequently changes and it's easy to move this kind of comment around.
