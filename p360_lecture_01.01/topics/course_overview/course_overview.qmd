# Course Overview

::: notes
Use this slide to frame the day.
Tell students this is the *map*, not the detail.
Emphasize that everything today is about orientation, not mastery.
:::

## What this class is about

- Structured programming using C++
- Learning how to think logically and precisely
- Building foundations for professional programming
- Programming as a way of reasoning

::: notes
Stress that this is not a “learn syntax” class.
The real goal is disciplined thinking.
Mention that syntax is just the surface representation of thought.
:::

## Why learn programming?

- Programming is intellectually challenging
- Programming is creative
- Programming is economically valuable
- Programming skills transfer across careers

::: notes
Pause here.
Ask students why *they* are taking the class.
Connect programming to problem-solving beyond software jobs.
:::

## Programming and thinking

- Modern problems require:
  - abstraction
  - decomposition
  - algorithmic reasoning
- Programming trains these habits
- These skills matter even in the age of AI

::: notes
This is where you can explicitly name GenAI.
Make the point: AI amplifies thinking, it does not replace it.
Programming is about knowing *what to ask* and *how to verify*.

## What is C++?

- A modern, high-performance language
- Used in:
  - systems
  - games
  - embedded software
  - performance-critical applications
- Not the same as C

::: notes
Do not get technical yet.
Focus on *why* C++ still exists.
Emphasize control, responsibility, and precision.
:::

---

## C++ has layers

- Can look like Python or Java
- Can also work close to the machine
- Supports multiple abstraction levels

::: notes
This slide reassures students.
Tell them they will not be thrown into the deep end immediately.
Explain that layering is a strength, not a complication.
:::

---

## Programming styles you will encounter

- Structured Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming

::: notes
Signal that this course starts with structured programming.
Object-oriented ideas will come later, once fundamentals are solid.
:::

---

## Structured Programming

- Focus on data
- Focus on transforming that data
- Core ideas:
  - sequence
  - selection
  - iteration

::: notes
This slide sets the intellectual spine of the semester.
You can say: “Everything we do for weeks fits in these three ideas.”
:::

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

- Focus on relationships
- Focus on interacting entities
- Will be emphasized later in the course

::: notes
Explicitly tell students not to worry about OOP yet.
Frame it as a future lens, not today’s task.
:::

---

## What you will learn to do

- Read and write correct C++ programs
- Trace program execution step by step
- Reason about variables, memory, and control flow
- Use professional tools and workflows

::: notes
Emphasize tracing and reasoning.
Tell them debugging is thinking, not guessing.
Mention tools briefly, not as the focus.
:::

---

## Expectations

- Programming requires practice
- Mistakes are expected
- Learning is iterative

::: notes
Normalize struggle here.
This is the slide where you set tone and trust.
Make it safe to fail early.
:::

## Roles in this class

- My role:
  - explain
  - guide
  - challenge
- Your role:
  - practice
  - think
  - ask questions

::: notes
Be explicit about partnership.
This is not passive content delivery.
You might say: “I can’t think for you.”
