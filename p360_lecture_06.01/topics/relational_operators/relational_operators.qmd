# Relational Operators

How does a program decide if one value is greater than another or if two values are equal? Today we'll learn about relational operators that allow programs to compare values and make decisions.

## What Are Relational Operators?

Relational operators compare two values and produce a boolean result (true or false). They are fundamental tools for making decisions in programs.

These operators allow us to ask questions like "Is x greater than y?" or "Are these two values equal?" The answer is always a boolean value.

## Equality Operators

The equality operators test whether two values are equal or not equal. When printed with cout, true displays as 1 and false displays as 0.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = 5;
int z = 3;

cout << (x == y);  // prints 1 (true)
cout << (x != z);  // prints 1 (true)
cout << (x == z);  // prints 0 (false)
```

The `==` operator tests if values are equal, while `!=` tests if values are not equal.

## Comparison Operators

The comparison operators test the relative magnitude of two values.

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

cout << (a < b);   // prints 1 (true)
cout << (a > b);   // prints 0 (false)
cout << (a <= 10); // prints 1 (true)
cout << (b >= 20); // prints 1 (true)
```

Less than (`<`), greater than (`>`), less than or equal (`<=`), and greater than or equal (`>=`) compare numerical relationships.

## Using Relational Operators

Relational operators can be used with variables of any comparable type, including int, double, and char. The result is always a bool value that can be stored or used directly.

```cpp
double price = 19.99;
double budget = 25.00;
bool canAfford = (price <= budget);  // true

char grade = 'B';
bool passedWithA = (grade == 'A');   // false
```

## Summary

Relational operators compare two values and return true or false. The six operators are `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.

## Common Practices

Always use parentheses around relational expressions when combining them with other operations to make your intent clear. This improves readability and prevents operator precedence confusion.

Use meaningful variable names when storing the results of relational comparisons. Names like `isValid`, `hasPermission`, or `isComplete` make your code self-documenting.

## Common Mistakes

Confusing the assignment operator (`=`) with the equality operator (`==`) is a frequent error. Remember that `=` assigns a value while `==` compares values.

Comparing floating-point numbers for exact equality using `==` can produce unexpected results due to rounding errors. Consider using a small tolerance range instead for floating-point comparisons.

## More Examples

```cpp
// Comparing different data types
int score = 85;
bool isPassing = (score >= 60);

// Multiple comparisons stored separately
int age = 25;
bool isAdult = (age >= 18);
bool isSenior = (age >= 65);

// Character comparisons
char grade = 'A';
bool gotTopGrade = (grade == 'A');
bool passedCourse = (grade >= 'D');
```

## Practice Problems

1. Write a relational expression that evaluates to true if a variable `temperature` is at or below freezing (32 degrees).
2. What does the expression `(10 != 5 + 5)` evaluate to?
3. Given `int x = 15;` and `int y = 20;`, write an expression that is true when x is less than y.
4. Write a boolean expression that is true when a variable `grade` is exactly 'A'.

## Questions for Reflection

1. Why do relational operators return boolean values rather than numbers?
2. In what situations would you use `!=` instead of `==`?
3. How might relational operators be used together with conditional statements to control program flow?
4. What are the potential issues with using `==` to compare floating-point numbers?
