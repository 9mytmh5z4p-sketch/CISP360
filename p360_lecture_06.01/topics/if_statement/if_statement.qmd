# The if Statement

How can programs make decisions based on conditions? The if statement allows your program to execute code only when specific conditions are true.

This introduction poses a question that engages students to think about conditional execution and decision-making in programming.

## What is an if Statement?

The if statement is a control structure that executes a block of code only when a specified condition evaluates to true. It is the fundamental building block for decision-making in C++ programs.

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code executed only if condition is true
}
```

The condition must be a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false. The code block enclosed in curly braces executes only when the condition is true.

::: notes
A simple flowchart showing the decision point would be helpful here: one path for true leading to code execution, another path for false that skips the code block.

## How if Statements Work

When an if statement is encountered, the program evaluates the condition in parentheses. If the condition is true, the code block executes and then program flow continues to the next statement after the if block.

```cpp
int temperature = 85;

if (temperature > 80) {
    cout << "It's hot outside!" << endl;
}

cout << "Program continues here" << endl;
```

## How if Statements Work

```cpp
int temperature = 85;

if (temperature > 80) {
    cout << "It's hot outside!" << endl;
}

cout << "Program continues here" << endl;
```

If the condition evaluates to false, the entire code block is skipped and execution continues immediately with the next statement after the if block.

::: notes
A timeline or execution flow diagram would illustrate the two possible paths: condition true (execute block then continue) versus condition false (skip block and continue).

## if Statement Examples

The if statement can be used with various comparison operators and boolean expressions to make decisions in your programs.


## if Statement Examples


::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="75%"}

```{.cpp code-line-numbers="2-5"} 
// Example 1: Simple comparison
int score = 95;
if (score >= 90) {
    cout << "Excellent grade!" << endl;
}

// Example 2: Checking equality
char grade = 'A';
if (grade == 'A') {
    cout << "Perfect score!" << endl;
}

// Example 3: Multiple statements in block
int age = 16;
if (age >= 16) {
    cout << "You can get a driver's license." << endl;
    cout << "Remember to study for the test!" << endl;
}
```
:::

::: {.column width="25%"}

Each example demonstrates how the if statement evaluates different types of conditions and executes the corresponding code blocks when conditions are met.

:::
:::

::: notes
Note that the specific variable values in these examples (score=95, grade='A', age=16) make all the conditions evaluate to true, which allows the code blocks to execute. When presenting, consider discussing what would happen if the values were different (e.g., score=75, grade='B', age=15) to reinforce understanding of conditional execution.

## Summary

The if statement enables conditional execution by running code blocks only when specified boolean conditions evaluate to true. Understanding if statements is essential for creating programs that respond to different situations and data values.

## Common Practices

Always use curly braces for if statement code blocks, even when the block contains only a single statement. This prevents errors when adding additional statements later and makes code more readable.

```cpp
// Recommended: Always use braces
if (x > 0) {
    cout << "Positive" << endl;
}

// Avoid: No braces (risky)
if (x > 0)
    cout << "Positive" << endl;
```

Use meaningful variable names and clear comparison operators to make your conditions self-documenting. Write conditions that are easy to understand without requiring comments.

## Common Mistakes

Using the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==) in conditions is a frequent error that causes unexpected behavior.

```cpp
// WRONG: Assignment instead of comparison
int value = 5;
if (value = 10) {  // This assigns 10 to value!
    cout << "This will always execute" << endl;
}

// CORRECT: Use == for comparison
if (value == 10) {
    cout << "Value is 10" << endl;
}
```

Forgetting curly braces when you intend multiple statements to execute conditionally results in only the first statement being part of the if block. The subsequent statements will always execute regardless of the condition.

## More Examples

These examples demonstrate additional scenarios where if statements provide decision-making capabilities.

```cpp
// Example: String comparison
string password = "secret123";
if (password == "secret123") {
    cout << "Access granted" << endl;
}

// Example: Logical condition with boolean variable
bool isRaining = true;
if (isRaining) {
    cout << "Bring an umbrella" << endl;
}

// Example: Compound condition result
int hours = 45;
bool overtime = (hours > 40);
if (overtime) {
    cout << "Overtime pay applies" << endl;
}
```

## Practice Problems

1. Write an if statement that displays "Minor" if a variable named age is less than 18.

2. Create an if statement that prints "Freezing" when a temperature variable is less than or equal to 32.

3. Write code that checks if a variable called balance is greater than 1000 and displays "VIP Customer" if true.

4. Implement an if statement that executes two cout statements when a boolean variable named isPremium is true.

## Questions for Reflection

1. What happens to the code inside an if statement's curly braces when the condition evaluates to false?

2. Why is it important to use the equality operator (==) rather than the assignment operator (=) in if statement conditions?

3. Can an if statement contain another if statement inside its code block? What might be a practical use case for this?

4. How does the if statement relate to the boolean expressions and comparison operators you learned previously?
