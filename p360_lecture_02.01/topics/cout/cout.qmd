# Displaying Output with `cout`

## Introduction

When you write a program, you need a way to communicate with the user. How does your program display results? How does it show messages? How does it tell the user what's happening?

That's where `cout` comes in!

---

## What is `cout`?

**`cout`** (pronounced "see-out") stands for **"character output"** or **"console output"**


- It sends data to the screen (the console/terminal)
- It's part of the `<iostream>` library
- It's in the `std` namespace

**Think of `cout` as your program's voice** - it's how your program "talks" to the user.

---

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for `cout` uses the **strean insertion operator** `<<`

```cpp
cout << "something to display";
```

**Read it as:** "send to cout" or "insert into cout"

The `<<` operator is like an arrow pointing toward `cout`, showing that data flows TO the output stream.

---

## Classic First Program


```{.cpp code-line-numbers="1|2|6"}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

---

**What's happening:**
1. `#include <iostream>` - Brings in the iostream library (where `cout` lives)
2. `using namespace std;` - Lets us write `cout` instead of `std::cout`
3. `cout << "Hello, World!";` - Sends the text to the screen
4. The semicolon `;` ends the statement

---

## Displaying Different Types of Data

- String Literals
- Numbers
- Variables


## Displaying Text (String Literals)

Text must be enclosed in **double quotes** `" "`

```cpp
cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming!";
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to C++ Programming!
```

## Displaying Numbers

Numbers don't need quotes:

```cpp
cout << 42;
cout << 3.14159;
cout << -17;
```

**Output:**
```
423.14159-17
```

**Notice:** Everything runs together! We'll fix this soon.

## Displaying Variables

You can display the **value** stored in a variable:

```cpp
int age = 25;
string name = "Alice";

cout << age;    // Displays: 25
cout << name;   // Displays: Alice
```

---

## Chaining Multiple Items

You can display multiple things in one statement by **chaining** them with `<<`

```cpp
cout << "Hello" << " " << "World";
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World
```

## Mixing Text and Variables

This is where `cout` becomes powerful:

```cpp
string name = "Bob";
int age = 30;

cout << "My name is " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old.";
```

**Output:**
```
My name is Bob and I am 30 years old.
```

**Notice:** 
- Text goes in quotes: `"My name is "`
- Variables don't use quotes: `name`
- Spaces in quotes: `" and I am "` (notice the spaces!)

---

## Adding New Lines

By default, `cout` doesn't move to the next line. Everything prints on the same line.

## Method 1: Using `endl`

`endl` stands for "end line" - it moves to the next line:

```cpp
cout << "First line" << endl;
cout << "Second line" << endl;
cout << "Third line" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
First line
Second line
Third line
```

## Method 2: Using `\n`

`\n` is the newline character:

```cpp
cout << "First line\n";
cout << "Second line\n";
cout << "Third line\n";
```

**Output:**
```
First line
Second line
Third line
```

## `endl` vs `\n` - What's the Difference?

Both create a new line, but:
- `endl` - Moves to next line AND flushes the output buffer (forces immediate display)
- `\n` - Just moves to next line (slightly faster)

**For beginners:** Use whichever you prefer. `endl` is more common and safer.

---

## Creating Space in Your Output

- Blank Lines
- Multiple Newlines
- Spaces in Text


## Blank Lines

```cpp
cout << "Paragraph 1" << endl;
cout << endl;  // Blank line
cout << "Paragraph 2" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```

## Multiple Newlines

```cpp
cout << "Top" << endl << endl << endl;
cout << "Bottom" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Top


Bottom
```

### Spaces in Text

```cpp
cout << "Hello    World";  // Multiple spaces in quotes
```

**Output:**
```
Hello    World
```

Hint: I use `.` instead spaces to make it easier to count.

---

```cpp
cout << "Hello....World";  // Multiple spaces in quotes
```

**Output:**
```
Hello....World
```

When you get everything lined up you type over the `.` with a space.

## Complete Example Program

Let's put it all together:

```cpp
// display_info.cpp - Demonstrating cout
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Variables
    string firstName = "Sarah";
    string lastName = "Johnson";
    int age = 22;
    double gpa = 3.85;
    
    // Display information
    cout << "=== Student Information ===" << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    cout << "Name: " << firstName << " " << lastName << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age << " years old" << endl;
    cout << "GPA: " << gpa << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    cout << "Thank you for using this program!" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

**Output:**
```
=== Student Information ===

Name: Sarah Johnson
Age: 22 years old
GPA: 3.85

Thank you for using this program!
```

## Special Characters and Escape Sequences

Sometimes you need to display special characters. Use the backslash `\` (called an escape character):

| Escape Sequence | Meaning | Example |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| `\n` | Newline (new line) | `"Line 1\nLine 2"` |
| `\t` | Tab (indent) | `"Name:\tValue"` |
| `\"` | Double quote | `"She said \"Hi\""` |
| `\\` | Backslash | `"C:\\folder\\file"` |

## Examples:

```cpp
cout << "Column1\tColumn2\tColumn3" << endl;
cout << "Value1\tValue2\tValue3" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Column1    Column2    Column3
Value1     Value2     Value3
```

---

```cpp
cout << "He said, \"Hello!\"" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
He said, "Hello!"
```

---

```cpp
cout << "First line\nSecond line\nThird line" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
First line
Second line
Third line
```

---

## Displaying Calculations

`cout` can display the result of calculations:

```cpp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

cout << "The sum is: " << a + b << endl;
cout << "The product is: " << a * b << endl;
cout << "The average is: " << (a + b) / 2 << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
The sum is: 30
The product is: 200
The average is: 15
```

**Important:** The calculation happens first, then the result is displayed.

---

## Common Patterns

## Pattern 1: Header and Content

```cpp
cout << "=== Title ===" << endl;
cout << "Content here" << endl;
cout << "=============" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
=== Title ===
Content here
=============
```

## Pattern 2: Labels and Values

```cpp
string item = "Laptop";
double price = 899.99;

cout << "Item:  " << item << endl;
cout << "Price: $" << price << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Item:  Laptop
Price: $899.99
```

## Pattern 3: Messages with Data

```cpp
int score = 95;
cout << "Your score of " << score << " is excellent!" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Your score of 95 is excellent!
```

## Pattern 4: Building Sentences

```cpp
string subject = "C++";
int hours = 3;

cout << "I studied " << subject;
cout << " for " << hours << " hours";
cout << " today." << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
I studied C++ for 3 hours today.
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

## Mistake 1: Forgetting Quotes Around Text

**WRONG:**
```cpp
cout << Hello;  // Error! C++ thinks Hello is a variable
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
cout << "Hello";  // Correct! Text needs quotes
```

## Mistake 2: Using Single Quotes for Text

**WRONG:**
```cpp
cout << 'Hello';  // Error! Single quotes are for single characters only
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
cout << "Hello";  // Use double quotes for text
cout << 'H';      // Single quotes for ONE character
```

## Mistake 3: Forgetting `#include <iostream>`

**WRONG:**
```cpp
// Missing #include <iostream>

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello";  // Error! cout doesn't exist
}
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello";  // Works!
}
```

## Mistake 4: Missing Semicolon

**WRONG:**
```cpp
cout << "Hello"  // Error! Missing semicolon
cout << "World";
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
cout << "Hello";  // Each statement needs semicolon
cout << "World";
```

## Mistake 5: Confusing Variables and Text

**WRONG:**
```cpp
int age = 25;
cout << "age";  // Displays: age (the word, not the value!)
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
int age = 25;
cout << age;   // Displays: 25 (the value)
cout << "age"; // Displays: age (the word)
```

**Remember:** 
- Quotes = literal text
- No quotes = variable or number

## Best Practices

## 1. Make Output Clear and Readable

**Poor:**
```cpp
cout << name << age << city;
```
**Output:** `Alice25Boston` (confusing!)

**Better:**
```cpp
cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
cout << "City: " << city << endl;
```
**Output:**
```
Name: Alice
Age: 25
City: Boston
```

## 2. Use Blank Lines to Organize

```cpp
cout << "=== Section 1 ===" << endl;
cout << "Content..." << endl;
cout << endl;  // Blank line

cout << "=== Section 2 ===" << endl;
cout << "More content..." << endl;
```

## 3. Label Your Output

**Poor:**
```cpp
cout << 42 << endl;
cout << 3.14 << endl;
```

**Better:**
```cpp
cout << "Answer: " << 42 << endl;
cout << "Pi: " << 3.14 << endl;
```

## 4. Use Consistent Formatting

Pick a style and stick with it:

```cpp
// Style 1: Everything on separate lines
cout << "Hello" << endl;
cout << "World" << endl;

// Style 2: Chain when related
cout << "Hello " << "World" << endl;

// Both are fine - just be consistent!
```

## Practical Examples

## Example 1: Personal Information

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string name = "Alex Chen";
    int age = 19;
    string major = "Computer Science";
    
    cout << "Student Profile" << endl;
    cout << "===============" << endl;
    cout << "Name:  " << name << endl;
    cout << "Age:   " << age << endl;
    cout << "Major: " << major << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Example 2: Simple Calculator Display

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1 = 15;
    int num2 = 7;
    
    cout << "Calculator" << endl;
    cout << "==========" << endl;
    cout << num1 << " + " << num2 << " = " << (num1 + num2) << endl;
    cout << num1 << " - " << num2 << " = " << (num1 - num2) << endl;
    cout << num1 << " * " << num2 << " = " << (num1 * num2) << endl;
    cout << num1 << " / " << num2 << " = " << (num1 / num2) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Example 3: Recipe Display

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string recipe = "Chocolate Chip Cookies";
    int servings = 24;
    int prepTime = 15;
    int bakeTime = 12;
    
    cout << "=== Recipe ===" << endl;
    cout << recipe << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    cout << "Servings: " << servings << " cookies" << endl;
    cout << "Prep Time: " << prepTime << " minutes" << endl;
    cout << "Bake Time: " << bakeTime << " minutes" << endl;
    cout << "Total Time: " << (prepTime + bakeTime) << " minutes" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
