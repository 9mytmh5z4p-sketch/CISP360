## Agenda

Today's topics:

- What is `cout` and why do we need it?
- Basic syntax and the `<<` operator
- Displaying text, numbers, and variables
- Chaining output with `<<`
- Creating new lines with `endl` and `\n`
- Common mistakes to avoid

::: notes
This is the foundational lecture. Advanced formatting, escape sequences, and patterns will be covered in a follow-up lecture.

<!-- Slide 1 -->

## What is `cout`?

**`cout`** (pronounced "see-out") stands for **"console output"**

**Purpose:** Sends data to the screen (the console/terminal)

**Requirements:**
- Part of the `<iostream>` library
- In the `std` namespace

**Think of `cout` as your program's voice** - it's how your program "talks" to the user.

::: notes
Emphasize that without cout, programs can't communicate results to users. Show the connection between #include <iostream> and being able to use cout.
:::

<!-- Slide 2 -->

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax uses the **stream insertion operator** `<<`

```cpp
cout << "something to display";
```

**Read it as:** "send to cout" or "insert into cout"

The `<<` operator is like an arrow pointing toward `cout`, showing that data flows TO the output stream.

::: notes
Draw an arrow showing data flowing from right to left into cout. Emphasize that << is an operator, not just syntax decoration.

<!-- Slide 3 -->

## Your First Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

**What's happening:**
- `#include <iostream>` brings in the iostream library (where `cout` lives)
- `using namespace std;` lets us write `cout` instead of `std::cout`
- `cout << "Hello, World!";` sends the text to the screen

<!-- Slide 4 -->

## Displaying Text

Text must be enclosed in **double quotes** `" "`

```cpp
cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming!";
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to C++ Programming!
```

**Rule:** Text (string literals) always needs double quotes.

::: notes
Common mistake: Students forget the quotes. Show what happens when you omit them - compiler thinks it's a variable name.
:::

<!-- Slide 5 -->

## Displaying Numbers and Variables

**Numbers** don't need quotes:

```cpp
cout << 42;
cout << 3.14159;
```

**Variables** don't need quotes either:

```cpp
int age = 25;
string name = "Alice";

cout << age;    // Displays: 25
cout << name;   // Displays: Alice
```

**Key distinction:** Quotes = literal text, No quotes = variable or number

<!-- Slide 6 -->

## Chaining Output

You can display multiple things in one statement by **chaining** with `<<`

```cpp
cout << "Hello" << " " << "World";
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World
```

**Mixing text and variables:**

```cpp
string name = "Bob";
int age = 30;

cout << "My name is " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old.";
```

**Output:**
```
My name is Bob and I am 30 years old.
```

::: notes
Emphasize that you need to include spaces in your quoted strings. Show what happens without the space in " and I am ".
:::

<!-- Slide 7 -->

## Adding New Lines

By default, `cout` doesn't move to the next line. Use `endl` or `\n`:

**Method 1: Using `endl`**
```cpp
cout << "First line" << endl;
cout << "Second line" << endl;
cout << "Third line" << endl;
```

**Method 2: Using `\n`**
```cpp
cout << "First line\n";
cout << "Second line\n";
cout << "Third line\n";
```

**Both produce:**
```
First line
Second line
Third line
```

<!-- Slide 8 -->

## `endl` vs `\n`

**`endl`** - Moves to next line AND flushes the output buffer

**`\n`** - Just moves to next line (slightly faster)

**For now:** Use whichever you prefer. Both work the same for simple programs.

**Creating blank lines:**
```cpp
cout << "Paragraph 1" << endl;
cout << endl;              // Blank line
cout << "Paragraph 2" << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```

<!-- Slide 9 -->

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Forgetting quotes around text**
```cpp
cout << Hello;   // ERROR - thinks Hello is a variable
cout << "Hello"; // CORRECT
```

**Mistake 2: Using single quotes for text**
```cpp
cout << 'Hello';  // ERROR - single quotes for ONE character only
cout << "Hello";  // CORRECT - double quotes for text
```

**Mistake 3: Confusing variables and text**
```cpp
int age = 25;
cout << "age";  // Displays: age (the word)
cout << age;    // Displays: 25 (the value)
```

<!-- Slide 10 -->

## Complete Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string firstName = "Sarah";
    string lastName = "Johnson";
    int age = 22;
    double gpa = 3.85;
    
    cout << "Student Information" << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    cout << "Name: " << firstName << " " << lastName << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age << " years old" << endl;
    cout << "GPA: " << gpa << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Student Information

Name: Sarah Johnson
Age: 22 years old
GPA: 3.85
```
