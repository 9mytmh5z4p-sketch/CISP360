# Getting User Input with `cin`

::: notes

:::


## Introduction

So far, we've been using `cout` to **output** information to the screen. But what if we want our programs to be interactive? What if we want to ask the user questions and get their answers?

That's where `cin` comes in!

---

## What is `cin`?

**`cin`** (pronounced "see-in") stands for **"character input"** or **"console input"**

- It reads data from the keyboard
- It's part of the `<iostream>` library (same as `cout`)
- It's in the `std` namespace

**Think of it this way:**

- `cout` = **output** (computer talks to user) -> screen
- `cin` = **input** (user talks to computer) <- keyboard

---

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for `cin` uses the **stream extraction operator** `>>`

```cpp
cin >> variableName;
``` 

- `cout` uses `<<` (insertion operator - puts data OUT)
- `cin` uses `>>` (extraction operator - pulls data IN)

**Think of the arrows:**

- `cout <<` - arrows point toward cout (data flows TO output)
- `cin >>` - arrows point away from cin (data flows FROM input)

---

## Simple Example

Let's write a program that asks for the user's age:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int age;  // Declare a variable to store the age
    
    cout << "How old are you? ";  // Ask the question
    cin >> age;                    // Wait for user input
    
    cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

**What happens when this runs:**

1. Program displays: "How old are you? "

2. Program **waits** for the user to type a number and press Enter

3. User types `25` and presses Enter

4. The value `25` is stored in the variable `age`

5. Program displays: "You are 25 years old."

---

## Key Concepts

## 1. The Variable Must Exist First

**WRONG:**
```cpp
cin >> age;  // Error! What is 'age'?
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
int age;     // Declare the variable first
cin >> age;  // Now we can read into it
```

## 2. The Variable Type Matters

`cin` automatically converts the input to match your variable type:

```cpp
int number;
cin >> number;     // Expects an integer (whole number)

double price;
cin >> price;      // Expects a decimal number

string name;
cin >> name;       // Expects text
```

::: notes
We will have entire lectures about what happens if it doesn't match.

## 3. The Program Waits

When your program reaches `cin`, it **stops and waits** for the user to:

1. Type something

2. Press Enter

This is called **blocking** - the program is blocked until input is received.

## Reading Different Data Types

## Reading Integers

```cpp
int numberOfPets;

cout << "How many pets do you have? ";
cin >> numberOfPets;

cout << "You have " << numberOfPets << " pets." << endl;
```

## Reading Decimals (Floating-Point)

```cpp
double temperature;

cout << "What is the temperature? ";
cin >> temperature;

cout << "It is " << temperature << " degrees." << endl;
```

## Reading Single Words (Strings)

```cpp
string firstName;

cout << "What is your first name? ";
cin >> firstName;

cout << "Hello, " << firstName << "!" << endl;
```

**Important:** `cin >>` only reads **one word** at a time. It stops at whitespace (spaces, tabs, Enter).

---

## Reading Multiple Values

You can read multiple values in one statement:

```cpp
int month, day, year;

cout << "Enter your birth month, day, and year: ";
cin >> month >> day >> year;

cout << "You were born on " << month << "/" << day << "/" << year << endl;
```

**User types:** `3 15 2005` (separated by spaces) and presses Enter

**Output:** `You were born on 3/15/2005`

---

## Reading Multiple Values Separately

You can also prompt for each value individually:

```cpp
string firstName, lastName;
int age;

cout << "Enter your first name: ";
cin >> firstName;

cout << "Enter your last name: ";
cin >> lastName;

cout << "Enter your age: ";
cin >> age;

cout << "Hello, " << firstName << " " << lastName << "!" << endl;
cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << endl;
```

---

## The Whitespace Problem

**Important limitation:** `cin >>` stops reading at the first whitespace (space, tab, or newline).

## Example of the Problem:

```cpp
string fullName;

cout << "What is your full name? ";
cin >> fullName;  // User types: John Smith

cout << "Your name is " << fullName << endl;
```

**Output:** `Your name is John`

**What happened?** `cin >>` only captured "John" and stopped at the space!

## Solution: `getline()`

For reading entire lines (including spaces), use `getline()`:

```cpp
string fullName;

cout << "What is your full name? ";
getline(cin, fullName);  // Reads the entire line

cout << "Your name is " << fullName << endl;
```

**Output:** `Your name is John Smith`

**Note:** We'll learn more about `getline()` in detail later.

## Complete Example Program

Here's a complete program that demonstrates `cin`:

```cpp
// input_demo.cpp - Demonstrating cin
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Declare variables
    string name;
    int age;
    double height;
    
    // Get user information
    cout << "=== Personal Information ===" << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    
    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;
    
    cout << "Enter your height in inches: ";
    cin >> height;
    
    // Display the information back
    cout << endl;
    cout << "=== Your Information ===" << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age << " years old" << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << " inches" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

**Sample Run:**
```
=== Personal Information ===

Enter your name: Alice
Enter your age: 20
Enter your height in inches: 65.5

=== Your Information ===
Name: Alice
Age: 20 years old
Height: 65.5 inches
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

## Mistake 1: Forgetting to Declare the Variable

**WRONG:**
```cpp
cout << "Enter your age: ";
cin >> age;  // Error! 'age' doesn't exist
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
int age;     // Declare first
cout << "Enter your age: ";
cin >> age;  // Now it works
```

## Mistake 2: Type Mismatch

**Problem:**
```cpp
int number;
cout << "Enter a number: ";
cin >> number;  // User types: "hello"
```

If the user enters something that doesn't match the type (like text when expecting a number), `cin` will fail and your program may behave unexpectedly.

**We'll learn how to handle this problem later in the course.**

## Mistake 3: Using `>>` for Multi-word Input

**WRONG for full names:**
```cpp
string fullName;
cin >> fullName;  // Only gets first word
```

**RIGHT for full names:**
```cpp
string fullName;
getline(cin, fullName);  // Gets entire line
```

## Mistake 4: No Prompt Message

**Confusing for users:**
```cpp
int age;
cin >> age;  // User sees cursor blinking - what do they enter?
```

**Better - always prompt:**
```cpp
int age;
cout << "Please enter your age: ";  // Clear prompt
cin >> age;
```

::: notes
Consider using this prompt pattern whenever you have to use cin.

## Good Practices

## 1. Always Prompt Before Input

**Bad:**
```cpp
cin >> value;  // User doesn't know what to enter
```

**Good:**
```cpp
cout << "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ";
cin >> value;
```

## 2. Use Descriptive Prompts

**Vague:**
```cpp
cout << "Enter number: ";
```

**Clear:**
```cpp
cout << "Enter the number of students in your class: ";
```

## 3. Echo the Input Back

Confirm what the user entered:

```cpp
int quantity;
cout << "How many items? ";
cin >> quantity;
cout << "You entered: " << quantity << endl;  // Echo back
```

## 4. Use Meaningful Variable Names

**Bad:**
```cpp
int x;
cin >> x;
```

**Good:**
```cpp
int numberOfStudents;
cin >> numberOfStudents;
```
