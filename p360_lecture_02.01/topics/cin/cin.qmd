# Getting User Input with `cin`

::: notes

:::


## Introduction

So far, we've been using `cout` to **output** information to the screen. But what if we want our programs to be interactive?

That's where `cin` comes in!

**Think of it this way:**

- `cout` = **output** (computer talks to user) → screen
- `cin` = **input** (user talks to computer) ← keyboard

## What is `cin`?

**`cin`** (pronounced "see-in") stands for **"character input"** or **"console input"**

- It reads data from the keyboard
- It's part of the `<iostream>` library (same as `cout`)
- It's in the `std` namespace

**Syntax:**
```cpp
cin >> variableName;
``` 

**Think of the arrows:**

- `cout <<` - arrows point toward cout (data flows TO output)
- `cin >>` - arrows point away from cin (data flows FROM input)

## Simple Example

Let's write a program that asks for the user's age:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int age;  // Declare a variable to store the age
    
    cout << "How old are you? ";  // Ask the question
    cin >> age;                    // Wait for user input
    
    cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**What happens:** Program displays the prompt, **waits** for input, stores the value in `age`, then displays the result.

## Key Rules for Using `cin`

## 1. Declare the Variable First

**WRONG:**
```cpp
cin >> age;  // Error! What is 'age'?
```

**RIGHT:**
```cpp
int age;     // Declare the variable first
cin >> age;  // Now we can read into it
```

## 2. Variable Type Matters

```cpp
int number;      // Expects whole numbers
cin >> number;   

double price;    // Expects decimal numbers
cin >> price;    

string name;     // Expects text
cin >> name;     
```

## Reading Different Data Types

```cpp
// Reading an integer
int numberOfPets;
cout << "How many pets do you have? ";
cin >> numberOfPets;

// Reading a decimal
double temperature;
cout << "What is the temperature? ";
cin >> temperature;

// Reading a single word
string firstName;
cout << "What is your first name? ";
cin >> firstName;
```

**Important:** `cin >>` only reads **one word** at a time. It stops at whitespace (spaces, tabs, Enter).

## Reading Multiple Values

You can read multiple values in one statement:

```cpp
int month, day, year;

cout << "Enter your birth month, day, and year: ";
cin >> month >> day >> year;

cout << "You were born on " << month << "/" << day << "/" << year << endl;
```

**User types:** `3 15 2005` (separated by spaces) and presses Enter

**Output:** `You were born on 3/15/2005`

## Complete Example Program

```cpp
// input_demo.cpp - Demonstrating cin
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string name;
    int age;
    double height;
    
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    
    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;
    
    cout << "Enter your height in inches: ";
    cin >> height;
    
    cout << "\nName: " << name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age << " years old" << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << " inches" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Common Mistakes

## Mistake 1: Forgetting to Declare

```cpp
cin >> age;  // Error! 'age' doesn't exist
```

## Mistake 2: No Prompt Message

```cpp
cin >> age;  // User doesn't know what to enter!
```

## Mistake 3: Using `>>` for Multi-word Input

```cpp
string fullName;
cin >> fullName;  // User types "John Smith"
// Only captures "John" - stops at space!
```

We'll learn about getline() for multi-word input in an advanced lecture.

## Good Practices

## Always Prompt Before Input

```cpp
cout << "Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ";
cin >> value;
```

## Echo the Input Back

```cpp
int quantity;
cout << "How many items? ";
cin >> quantity;
cout << "You entered: " << quantity << endl;
```

## Use Meaningful Variable Names

```cpp
int numberOfStudents;  // Good
cin >> numberOfStudents;

int x;  // Bad - unclear
cin >> x;
```

## Practice Exercises

::: notes
Students may want to try these at home.
:::

## Exercise 1: Rectangle Calculator

Write a program that asks for the length and width of a rectangle, then calculates and displays the area.

## Exercise 2: Personal Greeting

Write a program that asks for the user's first name and favorite color, then displays a personalized message using both inputs.

## Exercise 3: Simple Math

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers, then displays their sum, difference, and product.
