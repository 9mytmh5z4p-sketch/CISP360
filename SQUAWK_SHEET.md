#### Outstanding Issues

###### Overall

- It wasn't until week 5ish that things started to come together. Consider rerunning my earlier lectures through my updated prompts.



##### Week 1

- Does not have the keybinding for the laser pointer.

###### Lecture-01.01

- last image does not have topic labels. It just displays the definitions.

###### Lecture 2.1

- Has a small-table css defined. Used to shrink a large table.

###### Lecture 2.2

- H2 has a css nowrap added.
- this now uses the global style sheet.

###### Lecture 3.1
- the debugging portion was god-awful boring.
- students seemed alternately terrified and bored.
- the debugging activity had a reference variable in it! GD! Claude!

###### Lecture 3.2

- slide 4.7 add more context.
- They don't tell a compelling story. Slides just info dump.
