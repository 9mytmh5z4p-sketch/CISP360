## Today's Agenda

# Key Takaways

- Vectors and Dynamic Storage. Vectors store multiple values of the same type in a single container, can grow or shrink dynamically using push_back() and pop_back(), and are accessed by zero-based indexing with square brackets.

- Range-Based For Loops. The range-based for loop syntax for (type element : container) automatically iterates through every element in a vector, creates a copy of each element for read-only operations, and eliminates the need for manual index management.


# Next Time

- Debugging
- Graphs
