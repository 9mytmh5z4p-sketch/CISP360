# Vectors

```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam defaultFontName Arial
skinparam backgroundColor white

start

:Initialize vector\nvector<int> nums = {10, 20, 30};

:Get first element from vector;

while (More elements in vector?) is (true)
  :Copy current element to loop variable\n(e.g., int num = 10);
  
  :Execute loop body\n(e.g., cout << num);
  
  :Move to next element;
endwhile (no)

:Continue with rest of program;

# Key Takaways

- Vectors and Dynamic Storage. Vectors store multiple values of the same type in a single container, can grow or shrink dynamically using push_back() and pop_back(), and are accessed by zero-based indexing with square brackets.

- Range-Based For Loops. The range-based for loop syntax for (type element : container) automatically iterates through every element in a vector, creates a copy of each element for read-only operations, and eliminates the need for manual index management.


# Next Time

- Debugging
- Graphs
