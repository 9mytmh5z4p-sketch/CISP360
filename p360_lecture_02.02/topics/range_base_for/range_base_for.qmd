# Range-Based For Loop in C++

## What is a range-based for loop?

You've learned how to access individual vector elements using indexes:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

cout << scores[0] << endl;
cout << scores[1] << endl;
cout << scores[2] << endl;
cout << scores[3] << endl;
cout << scores[4] << endl;
```

---

But what if you have 100 scores? Typing each one would be tedious!

What to do, what to do?

---

**Range-Based for Loop**

The **range-based for loop** (also called a "for-each loop") automatically goes through **every element** in a container like a vector.

Think of it as: "**For each** element in the vector, do something with it."

## Why use range-based for loops?

Range-based for loops make your code:

- **Cleaner** - No index management needed
- **Easier to read** - The intent is clear
- **Less error-prone** - No risk of wrong indexes
- **More concise** - Fewer lines of code
- **More modern** - Introduced in C++11

---

**Compare these two approaches:**

**Without range-based loop (manual indexing):**
```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

for (int i = 0; i < scores.size(); i++) {
    cout << scores[i] << endl;
}
```

I know you haven't learned this loop yet, but this is what you would need to do if we didn't have the eor-each loop.

---

**With range-based loop:**
```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

for (int score : scores) {
    cout << score << endl;
}
```

Both produce the same output, but the range-based loop is simpler!

## Basic syntax

The basic syntax of a range-based for loop:

```cpp
for (type element : container) {
    // Use element here
}
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `for` - The for loop keyword
- `type` - The data type of each element
- `element` - A variable name you choose (holds each value)
- `:` - Read as "in" (for each element **in** container)
- `container` - The vector (or other container) to loop through

---

**Example:**
```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

for (int score : scores) {
    cout << score << endl;
}
```

Read as: "**For each int score in scores**, display the score"

## How it works - Step by step

Let's see what happens at each step:

```{.cpp} 
vector<string> fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};

for (string fruit : fruits) {   // apple
    cout << fruit << endl;
}
```

**Step 1:** `fruit` gets the first element ("Apple")
- Executes: `cout << "Apple" << endl;`

---

```{.cpp} 
vector<string> fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};

for (string fruit : fruits) {   // banana
    cout << fruit << endl;
}
```

**Step 2:** `fruit` gets the second element ("Banana")
- Executes: `cout << "Banana" << endl;`

---

```{.cpp} 
vector<string> fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};

for (string fruit : fruits) {   // orange
    cout << fruit << endl;
}
```

**Step 3:** `fruit` gets the third element ("Orange")
- Executes: `cout << "Orange" << endl;`

---

```{.cpp} 
vector<string> fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};

for (string fruit : fruits) {   // null
    cout << fruit << endl;
}
```

**Step 4:** No more elements, loop ends

---

```{.cpp} 
vector<string> fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};

for (string fruit : fruits) {
    cout << fruit << endl;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Apple
Banana
Orange
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Start Loop** - Begin range-based for loop
2. **Check** - Are there more elements in the vector?
3. **Assign** - If yes, copy next element to loop variable
4. **Execute** - Run the code block with current element
5. **Loop back** - Go back to check for more elements
6. **Exit** - When no more elements, exit loop

## Your first range-based for loop

Here's a complete example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    
    cout << "The numbers are:" << endl;
    
    for (int num : numbers) {
        cout << num << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

**Output:**
```
The numbers are:
10
20
30
40
50
```

**What happened:**
- The loop automatically went through each element
- Each time, `num` held the current value
- We displayed each value
- No indexes needed!

## Range-based loops with different types

Range-based for loops work with vectors of any type.

**Integer vectors:**

```cpp
vector<int> ages = {25, 30, 22, 35, 28};

for (int age : ages) {
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
}
```

---

**Output:**
```
Age: 25
Age: 30
Age: 22
Age: 35
Age: 28
```

---

**Double vectors:**

```cpp
vector<double> prices = {19.99, 24.50, 15.75, 32.00};

for (double price : prices) {
    cout << "$" << price << endl;
}
```

**Output:**
```
$19.99
$24.50
$15.75
$32.00
```

---

**String vectors:**

```cpp
vector<string> names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana"};

for (string name : names) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Hello, Charlie!
Hello, Diana!
```

## Naming the loop variable

You can name the loop variable anything you want. Choose names that make sense!

**Good names:**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};
for (int score : scores) { }  // Clear and descriptive

vector<string> cities = {"Paris", "London", "Tokyo"};
for (string city : cities) { }  // Singular of container name

vector<double> temperatures = {72.5, 68.3, 75.1};
for (double temp : temperatures) { }  // Abbreviation is fine
```

---

**Avoid confusing names:**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};
for (int x : scores) { }  // Too generic
for (int data : scores) { }  // Vague
for (int scores : scores) { }  // Same as container name - confusing!
```

**Convention:** Use the singular form of your vector name for the loop variable.

## Calculating with range-based loops

Range-based for loops are perfect for calculations involving all elements.

**Example: Sum of all elements**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

int total = 0;

for (int score : scores) {
    total += score;
}

cout << "Total: " << total << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Total: 438
```

---

**How it works:**
- Start with `total = 0`
- First iteration: `total = 0 + 85 = 85`
- Second iteration: `total = 85 + 92 = 177`
- Third iteration: `total = 177 + 78 = 255`
- Fourth iteration: `total = 255 + 95 = 350`
- Fifth iteration: `total = 350 + 88 = 438`

## Complete example - Average calculator

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> testScores = {88, 92, 76, 95, 85};
    
    cout << "Test Scores:" << endl;
    
    // Display all scores
    for (int score : testScores) {
        cout << score << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    // Calculate total
    int total = 0;
    for (int score : testScores) {
        total += score;
    }
    
    // Calculate average
    double average = static_cast<double>(total) / testScores.size();
    
    cout << fixed << setprecision(1);
    cout << "Total Points: " << total << endl;
    cout << "Average Score: " << average << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

**Output:**
```
Test Scores:
88 92 76 95 85 
Total Points: 436
Average Score: 87.2
```

## Formatting output with range-based loops

Range-based loops work great with formatting manipulators.

---

**Example: Price list with formatting**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> items = {"Coffee", "Bread", "Eggs", "Milk", "Butter"};
    vector<double> prices = {4.99, 2.50, 3.75, 3.25, 4.50};
    
    cout << "===== SHOPPING LIST =====" << endl;
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
    
    int index = 0;
    for (string item : items) {
        cout << setw(10) << left << item 
             << " $" << setw(6) << right << prices[index] << endl;
        index++;
    }
    
    // Calculate total
    double total = 0;
    for (double price : prices) {
        total += price;
    }
    
    cout << "=========================" << endl;
    cout << "TOTAL:     $" << setw(6) << right << total << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

**Output:**
```
===== SHOPPING LIST =====
Coffee     $  4.99
Bread      $  2.50
Eggs       $  3.75
Milk       $  3.25
Butter     $  4.50
=========================
TOTAL:     $ 18.99
```

## Copy behavior - Important concept

The range-based for loop **copies** each element into the loop variable.

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};

for (int score : scores) {
    cout << score << endl;
}
```

**What's happening:**
- Each element is **copied** from the vector into `score`
- `score` is a **separate variable** with its own copy
- Changes to `score` inside the loop do NOT affect the vector

**This is perfect for read-only operations!**

---

```cpp
vector<int> numbers = {10, 20, 30};

for (int num : numbers) {
    num = num * 2;  // Changes num, NOT the vector
}

// Vector is unchanged
for (int num : numbers) {
    cout << num << " ";  // Displays: 10 20 30
}
```

## Complete example - Shopping cart calculator

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> items = {"Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard", "Monitor", "Webcam"};
    vector<int> quantities = {1, 2, 1, 1, 1};
    vector<double> prices = {899.99, 24.50, 79.99, 299.99, 89.95};
    
    cout << "========== SHOPPING CART ==========" << endl;
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
    cout << left;
    
    // Display items
    cout << setw(12) << "Item" 
         << setw(8) << "Qty" 
         << setw(10) << "Price" 
         << setw(10) << "Subtotal" << endl;
    cout << string(40, '-') << endl;
    
    int index = 0;
    double grandTotal = 0;
    
    for (string item : items) {
        double itemTotal = quantities[index] * prices[index];
        grandTotal += itemTotal;
        
        cout << setw(12) << item 
             << setw(8) << quantities[index]
             << "$" << setw(9) << prices[index]
             << "$" << setw(9) << itemTotal << endl;
        
        index++;
    }
    
    cout << string(40, '=') << endl;
    cout << setw(30) << "TOTAL:" << "$" << setw(9) << grandTotal << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

---

**Output:**
```
========== SHOPPING CART ==========
Item        Qty     Price     Subtotal  
----------------------------------------
Laptop      1       $899.99   $899.99   
Mouse       2       $24.50    $49.00    
Keyboard    1       $79.99    $79.99    
Monitor     1       $299.99   $299.99   
Webcam      1       $89.95    $89.95    
========================================
                        TOTAL: $1418.92
```

## Using const with range-based loops

For read-only operations, you can use `const` to make your intent clear and prevent accidental modifications.

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

for (const int score : scores) {
    cout << score << endl;
    // score = 100;  // This would cause a compiler error!
}
```

---

**Why use const:**
- Makes code **safer** - prevents accidental changes
- Documents **intent** - clearly read-only
- May allow compiler **optimizations**

**Best practice:** Use `const` when you're only reading values, not modifying them.

## Common patterns with range-based loops

**Pattern 1: Display all elements**
```cpp
for (type element : container) {
    cout << element << endl;
}
```

**Pattern 2: Sum all elements**
```cpp
type total = 0;
for (type element : container) {
    total += element;
}
```

**Pattern 3: Count matching elements**
```cpp
int count = 0;
for (type element : container) {
    if (element meets condition) {
        count++;
    }
}
```

## Common mistakes with range-based loops

**Mistake 1: Wrong data type**

```cpp
vector<double> prices = {19.99, 24.50, 15.75};

for (int price : prices) {  // WRONG! Should be double
    cout << price;  // Truncates to integers: 19, 24, 15
}
```

**Fix:**
```cpp
for (double price : prices) {  // Correct type
    cout << price;
}
```

---

**Mistake 2: Same name for loop variable and container**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};

for (int scores : scores) {  // CONFUSING! Same name
    cout << scores;
}
```

**Fix:**
```cpp
for (int score : scores) {  // Use singular form
    cout << score;
}
```

---

**Mistake 3: Trying to access index**

```cpp
vector<string> names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};

for (string name : names) {
    cout << i << ": " << name;  // ERROR! i doesn't exist
}
```

**Fix (if you need index, use traditional for loop):**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {
    cout << i << ": " << names[i];
}
```

---

**Mistake 4: Expecting modifications to affect vector**

```cpp
vector<int> numbers = {10, 20, 30};

for (int num : numbers) {
    num = num * 2;  // Changes num, NOT the vector!
}
// Vector is still {10, 20, 30}
```

**Note:** This isn't an error, but a misunderstanding. The loop variable is a **copy**.

::: notes
This is why I haven't demonstrated how to mutate for-each loops.

Create a vector of Celsius temperatures and:
- Display each Celsius temperature
- Convert each to Fahrenheit using: F = (C × 9/5) + 32
- Display each converted temperature
- Calculate the average in both scales

## Summary

Range-based for loops provide a clean, simple way to process every element in a vector.

**Key concepts covered:**
- Syntax: `for (type element : container)`
- Automatic iteration through all elements
- No index management needed
- Works with vectors of any type
- Perfect for read-only operations
- Cleaner and less error-prone than traditional for loops
- Loop variable contains a **copy** of each element
- Using `const` for safety in read-only operations

---

**When to use range-based for loops:**
- Processing all elements
- Calculations (sum, average, product)
- Counting elements that meet criteria
- Finding min/max values
- Searching for values
- Displaying all elements
- Any operation that doesn't need indexes

---

**Remember:**
- Choose descriptive loop variable names (singular of container name)
- Match the data type to the vector's element type
- Range-based loops copy elements (safe for reading)
- Use `const` when only reading values
- For operations needing indexes, use traditional for loops

Practice using range-based for loops with different vector types and operations. They'll become your go-to tool for processing collections!

---

# Key Takeaways

## 1. Range-based for loops automatically iterate through every element in a vector

The syntax `for (type element : container)` eliminates the need for index management and automatically processes each element in order. Read it as "for each element in container" - the loop variable gets each value one at a time, making your code cleaner and less error-prone. This is perfect when you need to work with all elements and don't care about their position numbers.

---

## 2. The loop variable is a copy of each element, making range-based loops ideal for read-only operations

Each iteration copies an element from the vector into the loop variable, so changes to the loop variable don't affect the original vector. This copy behavior makes range-based loops perfect for displaying, calculating sums/averages, counting, searching, and finding min/max values. Use `const` in the declaration (e.g., `for (const int score : scores)`) to document read-only intent and prevent accidental modifications.

---

## 3. Use range-based loops when processing all elements without needing indexes

Choose range-based for loops over traditional for loops when you need to process every element and don't need position information. They excel at summing values, counting elements that meet criteria, finding extremes, and displaying data. If you need the index number or must process multiple vectors in parallel, use a traditional for loop instead. The cleaner syntax of range-based loops makes them the modern C++ preferred approach for simple iteration.
