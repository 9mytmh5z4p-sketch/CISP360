# Coding Exercise

## Exercise Goals

- Increase Topic Mastery
- Construct Knowledge
- Give you data to evaluate how well you are learning.

## Task

Duplicate the following program. Run it successfully.

## Program

Write a program that does the following:

1. Create a vector that stores 7 temperature readings (as doubles) representing the high temperature for each day of the week.
2. Initialize the vector with these values when you declare it:

    - Monday: 72.5, Tuesday: 68.3, Wednesday: 75.0, Thursday: 71.2, Friday: 69.8, Saturday: 73.6, Sunday: 70.1

3. Display all temperatures using a for-each loop. Each temperature should be on its own line with appropriate labels (Day 1, Day 2, etc.).
4. Calculate and display the average temperature for the week. Use a for-each loop to sum all the temperatures, then divide by the number of days.
5. Format your output so that all temperatures display with exactly 1 decimal place.

```cpp
// inClass_2-1.cpp
// Author: [Student Name]
// Date: [Current Date]
// Description: This program analyzes weekly temperature data using vectors
//              and for-each loops to calculate and display statistics.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Create and initialize vector with weekly temperatures
    vector<double> temperatures = {72.5, 68.3, 75.0, 71.2, 69.8, 73.6, 70.1};
    
    // Display header
    cout << "Weekly Temperature Report" << endl;
    cout << "-------------------------" << endl;
    
    // Display all temperatures using for-each loop
    int dayNumber = 1;
    for (double temp : temperatures)
    {
        cout << "Day " << dayNumber << ": " << fixed << setprecision(1) 
             << temp << endl;
        dayNumber++;
    }
    
    // Calculate average temperature
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (double temp : temperatures)
    {
        sum += temp;
    }
    double average = sum / temperatures.size();
    
    // Display average
    cout << endl;
    cout << "Average temperature: " << fixed << setprecision(1) 
         << average << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
