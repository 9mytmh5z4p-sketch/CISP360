# Introduction to<br> std::vector in C++

## What is a vector?

You've learned about individual variables that store single values:

```cpp
int age = 25;
double price = 19.99;
string name = "Alice";
```

But what if you need to store **multiple related values**? Like:

- Test scores for 10 students
- Temperatures for each day of the week
- Prices of 5 different products
- Names of all your friends


## &nbsp;

You *could* do this:

```cpp
int score1 = 85;
int score2 = 92;
int score3 = 78;
int score4 = 95;
int score5 = 88;
```

## &nbsp;

But this is tedious and doesn't scale! What if you had 100 scores?

**Enter the vector!**

## &nbsp;

A **vector** is a container that holds **multiple values of the same type** in a single variable.

Think of it as a row of boxes, all labeled with the same variable name, where each box holds one value.

```
scores: [ 85 ] [ 92 ] [ 78 ] [ 95 ] [ 88 ]
         [0]    [1]    [2]    [3]    [4]
```

## Why use vectors?

Vectors solve several problems:

- **Store multiple related values** under one name
- **Organized** - Keep related data together
- **Flexible** - Can hold any number of items
- **Easy to process** - Can access any element by position
- **Part of the STL** (Standard Template Library) - Built into C++

## Including vector in your program

To use vectors, you must include the `<vector>` header:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>  // Required for std::vector
using namespace std;
```

Just like you include `<iostream>` for `cout` and `<string>` for strings, you need `<vector>` for vectors.

## Basic vector syntax

The basic syntax for declaring a vector:

```cpp
vector<type> name;
```

- `vector` - The container type
- `<type>` - The type of data it will hold (int, double, string, etc.)
- `name` - Your variable name

## &nbsp;

**Examples:**

```cpp
vector<int> scores;           // Vector of integers
vector<double> prices;        // Vector of doubles
vector<string> names;         // Vector of strings
vector<char> grades;          // Vector of characters
```

**Important:** All elements in a vector must be the **same type**.

## Initializing a vector with values

The most common way to create a vector is to initialize it with values:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};
```

This creates a vector named `scores` containing 5 integers.

## &nbsp;

**More examples:**

```cpp
vector<double> temperatures = {72.5, 68.3, 75.1, 71.8, 69.5};
vector<string> days = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"};
vector<char> grades = {'A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'};
vector<bool> answers = {true, false, true, true, false};
```

**Note:** The curly braces `{ }` contain the values, separated by commas.

## Accessing vector elements

Each element in a vector has an **index** (position number).

**Important:** Indexes start at **0**, not 1!

```
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};
                      
Index:                 0   1   2   3   4
Value:                85  92  78  95  88
```

## &nbsp;

To access an element, use square brackets `[ ]`:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

cout << scores[0];  // Displays: 85 (first element)
cout << scores[1];  // Displays: 92 (second element)
cout << scores[2];  // Displays: 78 (third element)
cout << scores[4];  // Displays: 88 (last element)
```

## Complete example - Accessing elements

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<double> prices = {19.99, 24.50, 15.75, 32.00, 8.25};
    
    cout << "First price: $" << prices[0] << endl;
    cout << "Second price: $" << prices[1] << endl;
    cout << "Third price: $" << prices[2] << endl;
    cout << "Fourth price: $" << prices[3] << endl;
    cout << "Fifth price: $" << prices[4] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## &nbsp;

**Output:**
```
First price: $19.99
Second price: $24.50
Third price: $15.75
Fourth price: $32.00
Fifth price: $8.25
```

## Getting the size of a vector

Every vector knows how many elements it contains. Use the `.size()` method:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

cout << "Number of scores: " << scores.size();  // Displays: 5
```

## &nbsp;

**More examples:**

```cpp
vector<string> names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
int count = names.size();  // count = 3

vector<double> temperatures = {72.5, 68.3, 75.1, 71.8, 69.5, 70.2, 73.8};
cout << temperatures.size();  // Displays: 7
```

**Important:** `.size()` returns the **count** of elements, not the last index!

- Size = 5 means indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Last index = size - 1

## Using size() to access the last element

Since the last index is always `size() - 1`, you can access the last element like this:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

cout << "First score: " << scores[0] << endl;
cout << "Last score: " << scores[scores.size() - 1] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
First score: 85
Last score: 88
```

## Accessing multiple elements

You can access and display multiple elements from a vector:

## &nbsp;

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> days = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"};
    
    cout << "First day of work week: " << days[0] << endl;
    cout << "Middle of work week: " << days[2] << endl;
    cout << "Last day of work week: " << days[4] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
First day of work week: Monday
Middle of work week: Wednesday
Last day of work week: Friday
```

## Using vector elements in calculations

Vector elements can be used in any calculation, just like regular variables:

```cpp
vector<double> prices = {19.99, 24.50, 15.75, 32.00, 8.25};

// Calculate total of first three items
double subtotal = prices[0] + prices[1] + prices[2];

cout << "Subtotal: $" << subtotal << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Subtotal: $60.24
```

## Vectors with different data types

Vectors work with any data type, not just numbers.

## &nbsp;

**String vectors:**

```cpp
vector<string> fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Mango", "Grape"};

cout << "First fruit: " << fruits[0] << endl;
cout << "Third fruit: " << fruits[2] << endl;
cout << "Last fruit: " << fruits[4] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
First fruit: Apple
Third fruit: Orange
Last fruit: Grape
```

## &nbsp;

**Boolean vectors:**

```cpp
vector<bool> answers = {true, false, true, true, false};

cout << boolalpha;  // Display as true/false
cout << "Answer 1: " << answers[0] << endl;
cout << "Answer 2: " << answers[1] << endl;
cout << "Answer 3: " << answers[2] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Answer 1: true
Answer 2: false
Answer 3: true
```

## Complete example - Student data

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> students = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Eve"};
    vector<int> scores = {88, 92, 78, 95, 85};
    
    // Display information for first student
    cout << "First student: " << students[0] << endl;
    cout << "Score: " << scores[0] << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    // Display information for third student
    cout << "Third student: " << students[2] << endl;
    cout << "Score: " << scores[2] << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    // Display information for last student
    int lastIndex = students.size() - 1;
    cout << "Last student: " << students[lastIndex] << endl;
    cout << "Score: " << scores[lastIndex] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## &nbsp;

**Output:**
```
First student: Alice
Score: 88

Third student: Charlie
Score: 78

Last student: Eve
Score: 85
```

## Using vectors to organize data

Vectors help you keep related information organized by index position.

## **Example: Product inventory**

## &nbsp;

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> products = {"Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard", "Monitor"};
    vector<int> quantities = {5, 25, 12, 8};
    vector<double> prices = {899.99, 24.50, 79.99, 299.99};
    
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
    
    // Display first product
    cout << "Product: " << products[0] << endl;
    cout << "Quantity: " << quantities[0] << endl;
    cout << "Price: $" << prices[0] << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    // Display third product
    cout << "Product: " << products[2] << endl;
    cout << "Quantity: " << quantities[2] << endl;
    cout << "Price: $" << prices[2] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
## &nbsp;

**Output:**
```
Product: Laptop
Quantity: 5
Price: $899.99

Product: Keyboard
Quantity: 12
Price: $79.99
```

## Displaying formatted vector data

You can use vectors with formatting manipulators you've learned:

## &nbsp;

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> items = {"Coffee", "Bread", "Eggs"};
    vector<double> prices = {4.99, 2.50, 3.75};
    
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
    cout << left;
    
    cout << "Item 1: " << setw(10) << items[0] << "$" << prices[0] << endl;
    cout << "Item 2: " << setw(10) << items[1] << "$" << prices[1] << endl;
    cout << "Item 3: " << setw(10) << items[2] << "$" << prices[2] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Item 1: Coffee    $4.99
Item 2: Bread     $2.50
Item 3: Eggs      $3.75
```

## Complete example - Temperature report

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> days = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"};
    vector<double> temps = {72.5, 68.3, 75.1, 71.8, 69.5};
    
    cout << fixed << setprecision(1);
    
    cout << "===== WEEKLY TEMPERATURE REPORT =====" << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    // Display each day individually
    cout << days[0] << ": " << temps[0] << "°F" << endl;
    cout << days[1] << ": " << temps[1] << "°F" << endl;
    cout << days[2] << ": " << temps[2] << "°F" << endl;
    cout << days[3] << ": " << temps[3] << "°F" << endl;
    cout << days[4] << ": " << temps[4] << "°F" << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    // Calculate average of all 5 days
    double average = (temps[0] + temps[1] + temps[2] + temps[3] + temps[4]) / 5.0;
    cout << "Average temperature: " << average << "°F" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## &nbsp;

**Output:**
```
===== WEEKLY TEMPERATURE REPORT =====

Monday: 72.5°F
Tuesday: 68.3°F
Wednesday: 75.1°F
Thursday: 71.8°F
Friday: 69.5°F

Average temperature: 71.4°F
```

## Common mistakes with vectors

**Mistake 1: Forgetting to include `<vector>`**

```cpp
// WRONG - Missing include
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> scores = {85, 92};  // Error! vector not defined
}
```

**Fix: Always include the header**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>  // Don't forget this!
using namespace std;
```

## &nbsp;

**Mistake 2: Accessing non-existent indexes**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};

cout << scores[5];  // ERROR! Only indexes 0, 1, 2 exist
```

**Fix: Only use valid indexes (0 to size-1)**

```cpp
cout << scores[0];  // Valid
cout << scores[1];  // Valid
cout << scores[2];  // Valid
// cout << scores[3];  // Would be invalid!
```

## &nbsp;

**Mistake 3: Forgetting indexes start at 0**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};

cout << scores[1];  // This is 92, not 85!
cout << scores[0];  // This is the first element: 85
```

## &nbsp;

**Mistake 4: Mixing types in a vector**

```cpp
// WRONG - Can't mix types
vector<int> values = {10, 3.14, 25};  // 3.14 will be converted to 3!
```

**Fix: All elements must be the same type**

```cpp
vector<double> values = {10.0, 3.14, 25.0};  // All doubles
```

## &nbsp;

**Mistake 5: Confusing size with last index**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

cout << scores[scores.size()];  // WRONG! Index 5 doesn't exist
```

**Fix: Last index is size() - 1**

```cpp
cout << scores[scores.size() - 1];  // Correct! Accesses index 4
```

## &nbsp;

**Mistake 6: Modifying non-existent indexes**

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};

scores[5] = 100;  // DANGER! Index 5 doesn't exist
```

**Fix: Use push_back() to add beyond current size**

```cpp
scores.push_back(100);  // Correct! Adds 100 at the end
```

## When to use vectors

Use vectors when you need to:

- Store multiple values of the same type
- Keep related data together
- Work with data sets (temperatures, scores, prices)
- Store collections of information
- Organize data by position

## &nbsp;

**Examples of good vector uses:**

- Student test scores
- Daily temperatures
- Product prices
- Employee names
- Monthly sales figures
- Game high scores

## Adding elements to a vector

You can add new elements to the end of a vector using `.push_back()`:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78};

cout << "Original size: " << scores.size() << endl;

scores.push_back(95);  // Add 95 to the end

cout << "New size: " << scores.size() << endl;
cout << "Last element: " << scores[3] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Original size: 3
New size: 4
Last element: 95
```

## &nbsp;

**What happened:**

- The vector originally had 3 elements (indexes 0, 1, 2)
- `push_back(95)` added 95 at the end (index 3)
- The size increased from 3 to 4

## push_back() with different types

`push_back()` works with any vector type:

**String vectors:**

```cpp
vector<string> fruits = {"Apple", "Banana"};

fruits.push_back("Orange");
fruits.push_back("Mango");

cout << "Third fruit: " << fruits[2] << endl;
cout << "Fourth fruit: " << fruits[3] << endl;
cout << "Total fruits: " << fruits.size() << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Third fruit: Orange
Fourth fruit: Mango
Total fruits: 4
```

## &nbsp;

**Double vectors:**

```cpp
vector<double> prices = {19.99, 24.50};

prices.push_back(15.75);
prices.push_back(32.00);

cout << "Third price: $" << prices[2] << endl;
cout << "Fourth price: $" << prices[3] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Third price: $15.75
Fourth price: $32.00
```

## Building a vector from scratch

You can start with an empty vector and add all elements with `push_back()`:

```cpp
vector<int> scores;  // Empty vector

cout << "Initial size: " << scores.size() << endl;

scores.push_back(85);
scores.push_back(92);
scores.push_back(78);
scores.push_back(95);

cout << "Final size: " << scores.size() << endl;
cout << "First score: " << scores[0] << endl;
cout << "Last score: " << scores[3] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Initial size: 0
Final size: 4
First score: 85
Last score: 95
```

## Building a shopping list Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> shoppingList;
    
    cout << "Building shopping list..." << endl;
    
    shoppingList.push_back("Milk");
    shoppingList.push_back("Bread");
    shoppingList.push_back("Eggs");
    shoppingList.push_back("Butter");
    
    cout << "\nShopping List (" << shoppingList.size() << " items):" << endl;
    cout << "1. " << shoppingList[0] << endl;
    cout << "2. " << shoppingList[1] << endl;
    cout << "3. " << shoppingList[2] << endl;
    cout << "4. " << shoppingList[3] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## &nbsp;

**Output:**
```
Building shopping list...

Shopping List (4 items):
1. Milk
2. Bread
3. Eggs
4. Butter
```

## Removing the last element

You can remove the last element from a vector using `.pop_back()`:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

cout << "Original size: " << scores.size() << endl;
cout << "Last element: " << scores[4] << endl;

scores.pop_back();  // Remove the last element (88)

cout << "New size: " << scores.size() << endl;
cout << "New last element: " << scores[3] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Original size: 5
Last element: 88
New size: 4
New last element: 95
```

## &nbsp;

**Important:** `pop_back()` does not return the removed value, it just removes it!

## pop_back() example - Undo last entry

```cpp
vector<string> tasks = {"Email", "Meeting", "Report", "Call"};

cout << "Tasks: " << tasks.size() << endl;
cout << "Last task: " << tasks[3] << endl;

cout << "\nOops! Removing last task..." << endl;
tasks.pop_back();

cout << "Tasks now: " << tasks.size() << endl;
cout << "Last task: " << tasks[2] << endl;
```

**Output:**
```
Tasks: 4
Last task: Call

Oops! Removing last task...
Tasks now: 3
Last task: Report
```

## Removing all elements

You can remove all elements from a vector using `.clear()`:

```cpp
vector<int> scores = {85, 92, 78, 95, 88};

cout << "Size before clear: " << scores.size() << endl;

scores.clear();  // Remove all elements

cout << "Size after clear: " << scores.size() << endl;

if (scores.empty()) {
    cout << "Vector is now empty!" << endl;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Size before clear: 5
Size after clear: 0
Vector is now empty!
```

## Complete example - Updating inventory

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<string> products = {"Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard"};
    vector<int> quantities = {5, 25, 12};
    
    cout << "===== INVENTORY =====" << endl;
    cout << products[0] << ": " << quantities[0] << endl;
    cout << products[1] << ": " << quantities[1] << endl;
    cout << products[2] << ": " << quantities[2] << endl;
    cout << endl;
    
    // Sell 2 laptops
    cout << "Sold 2 laptops..." << endl;
    quantities[0] = quantities[0] - 2;
    
    // Add new product
    cout << "Added new product..." << endl;
    products.push_back("Monitor");
    quantities.push_back(8);
    
    cout << "\n===== UPDATED INVENTORY =====" << endl;
    cout << products[0] << ": " << quantities[0] << endl;
    cout << products[1] << ": " << quantities[1] << endl;
    cout << products[2] << ": " << quantities[2] << endl;
    cout << products[3] << ": " << quantities[3] << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## &nbsp;

**Output:**
```
===== INVENTORY =====
Laptop: 5
Mouse: 25
Keyboard: 12

Sold 2 laptops...
Added new product...

===== UPDATED INVENTORY =====
Laptop: 3
Mouse: 25
Keyboard: 12
Monitor: 8
```

## Practical example - Score tracker

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> scores;
    
    cout << "===== GAME SCORE TRACKER =====" << endl;
    
    // Add scores from three rounds
    cout << "Round 1 score: 150" << endl;
    scores.push_back(150);
    
    cout << "Round 2 score: 200" << endl;
    scores.push_back(200);
    
    cout << "Round 3 score: 175" << endl;
    scores.push_back(175);
    
    cout << "\nTotal rounds: " << scores.size() << endl;
    
    // Calculate total
    int total = scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2];
    double average = total / 3.0;
    
    cout << fixed << setprecision(1);
    cout << "Total score: " << total << endl;
    cout << "Average: " << average << endl;
    
    // Improve first score
    cout << "\nBonus! Updating round 1 score..." << endl;
    scores[0] = 180;
    
    // Recalculate
    total = scores[0] + scores[1] + scores[2];
    average = total / 3.0;
    
    cout << "New total: " << total << endl;
    cout << "New average: " << average << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## &nbsp;

**Output:**
```
===== GAME SCORE TRACKER =====
Round 1 score: 150
Round 2 score: 200
Round 3 score: 175

Total rounds: 3
Total score: 525
Average: 175.0

Bonus! Updating round 1 score...
New total: 555
New average: 185.0
```

## Common operations summary

**Adding elements:**
```cpp
vector<int> nums = {10, 20};
nums.push_back(30);     // Add 30 to end
```

**Removing elements:**
```cpp
vector<int> nums = {10, 20, 30};
nums.pop_back();        // Remove last element (30)
nums.clear();           // Remove all elements
```

**Checking size:**
```cpp
vector<int> nums = {10, 20, 30};
cout << nums.size();    // Displays: 3
if (nums.empty()) { }   // Check if empty
```

## What we're NOT covering yet

There are more advanced vector operations we'll learn later:

- Inserting at specific positions (not just the end)
- Removing elements from the middle
- Sorting vectors
- Searching efficiently
- Loops to process all elements
