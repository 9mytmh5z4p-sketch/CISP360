## Last Time

::: {.incremental}

- **Programming is about disciplined thinking, not memorizing syntax.** Last time we talked about this course as training your ability to think logically, precisely, and deliberately, with C++ serving as the medium rather than the goal itself.  ￼

- **We are starting with structured programming as our foundation.** I emphasized that we will focus first on sequence, selection, and iteration, because these ideas form the backbone of how programs execute and how programmers reason about behavior.  ￼

::: {.incremental}

- **All programs share a small set of universal elements.** We introduced identifiers, reserved words, literals, and comments, and discussed why understanding their roles matters more than memorizing examples.  ￼


- **Every C++ program has a predictable structure.** We walked through the idea that programs are divided into top matter that sets the environment and the main() function where execution always begins.  ￼

- **Learning to program is iterative and requires practice.** qI stressed that mistakes are expected, that debugging is part of thinking, and that the exercise was meant to reinforce structure and confidence rather than perfection.  ￼

# Key Takaways

1. **Data Types & Memory Control**: C++ uses specific types (like `int`, `double`, and `bool`) to allow programmers to precisely manage memory reservation and data behaviors.


2. **Variable Management**: Variables must be declared before use, while keywords like `const` (for read-only data) and `auto` (for type inference) streamline assignment logic.


3. **Arithmetic Logic**: Mathematical operations follow standard algebraic precedence, with integer division resulting in truncation and the modulus operator (`%`) used to find remainders.


# Next Time

- `cin`
- `cout`
- Manipulators
- Table Architectures
