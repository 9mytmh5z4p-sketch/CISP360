# Arithmetic Operators

## Foundation

These are the basic building blocks whenever you need to transform anything.

Fortunately, they function almost the same way they did when you first learned about them years ago.

## Table of Arithmetic Operations

| Operators | Meaning | Example | Result |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| + | Addition | 4+2 | 6 |
| - | Subtraction | 4-2 | 2 |
| * | Multiplication | 4*2 | 8 |
| / | Division | 4/2 | 2 |
| % | Modulus operator to get remainder in integer division | 5%2 | 1 |

## Code Examples

```cpp
// Addition
int sum = 10 + 5;  // sum = 15

// Subtraction
int difference = 10 - 5;  // difference = 5

// Multiplication
int product = 10 * 5;  // product = 50

// Division
int quotient = 10 / 5;  // quotient = 2

// Modulus
int remainder = 10 % 3;  // remainder = 1
```

## Integer Division

You didn't get this in elementary school!

Whenever you divide two integers together you get an integer!

Integer division drops the fractions.

```cpp
int x = 7/2;      // 3, not 3.5
int y = 1/2;      // 0 (surprise!)
```

## Division by Zero

- Crash your program (if you are lucky).
- Logic errors (if you are not).

## Mixed Operations

We will discuss what happens when you perform a mathematical operation between **different** data types later.

## Operator Precedence

Arithmetic operators follow the same order of operations you learned in math class.

**Order (highest to lowest priority):**

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, Modulus `%`
3. Addition `+`, Subtraction `-`

---

**Examples:**
```cpp
int result1 = 5 + 3 * 2;      // result1 = 11 (not 16)
int result2 = (5 + 3) * 2;    // result2 = 16
int result3 = 10 - 6 / 2;     // result3 = 7 (not 2)
```

**Tip:** When in doubt, use parentheses to make your intentions clear!


## Compound Assignment Operators

Shortcuts for modifying a variable using arithmetic operations.

**Syntax:** `variable operator= value` is equivalent to `variable = variable operator value`

---

| Operator | Meaning | Example | Equivalent To |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| `+=` | Add and assign | x += 5 | x = x + 5 |
| `-=` | Subtract and assign | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 |
| `*=` | Multiply and assign | x *= 2 | x = x * 2 |
| `/=` | Divide and assign | x /= 4 | x = x / 4 |
| `%=` | Modulus and assign | x %= 3 | x = x % 3 |


---

**Example:**

```cpp
int score = 100;
score += 50;   // score is now 150
score -= 20;   // score is now 130
score *= 2;    // score is now 260
```

## The cmath Library

C++ provides a powerful math library with advanced mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic.

**To use it, include at the top of your program:**
```cpp
#include <cmath>
```
---

**Common functions:**

| Function | Purpose | Example | Result |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| `sqrt(x)` | Square root | `sqrt(16)` | 4.0 |
| `pow(x, y)` | x raised to power y | `pow(2, 3)` | 8.0 |
| `abs(x)` | Absolute value | `abs(-5)` | 5 |
| `ceil(x)` | Round up | `ceil(4.3)` | 5.0 |
| `floor(x)` | Round down | `floor(4.7)` | 4.0 |
| `round(x)` | Round to nearest | `round(4.5)` | 5.0 |

---

**Example:**
```cpp
double radius = 5.0;
double area = M_PI * pow(radius, 2);  // area = 78.54
```

## Remember

C++ arithmetic operators work like basic math but with important programming-specific behaviors: integer division truncates decimals, the modulus operator (%) returns remainders, and compound assignment operators (like +=) provide convenient shortcuts for updating variables. For advanced mathematical functions beyond the five basic operators, the cmath library offers tools like square roots, powers, and rounding functions.
