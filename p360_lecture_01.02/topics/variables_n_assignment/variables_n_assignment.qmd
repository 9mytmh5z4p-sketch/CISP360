# Variables and Assignment


## Why Do This?

- Variables are used to store data.
- Under program control (unlike literals).


## Setting up a variable

- Recall we need to tell the computer to set up a variable (**declaration**).
- We do not need to assign data to it (**initialization**).
- But initializing is a really, really good idea.

## Declaration, Initialization, and Assignment

```cpp
int x;      // Declaration, no initialization
int y = 25; // Declaration + Initialization

y = 30;     // Assignment, as variable already exists
```

## = Does not mean what you think it does

In programming `=` is **not** the equals sign.

It's called the Assignment Operator and it means we are moving data around in memory.

## Remember

Variables are the key: If we don’t declare and initialize our variables, there’s very little we can do.
