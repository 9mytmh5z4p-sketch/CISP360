## Last Time

::: {.incremental}
1. **Course Philosophy**: Focuses on **Structured Programming** as a way of reasoning, emphasizing logical thinking, abstraction, and decomposition rather than just learning syntax.
2. **C++ Characteristics**: A modern, high-performance language that supports multiple "layers" of abstraction, allowing it to work close to the machine or look similar to high-level languages like Java.
